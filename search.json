    "text": "Introduction\nWelcome to Biological and Biomedical Data Science, a second-year course in the Georgetown University Masters in Data Analytics program.\nBiological and biomedical data are at the heart of many industries, including the life sciences, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, to name a few. Research and development in these industries aim to create new knowledge about biology (human, animal or agricultural) and use that knowledge to create products (medicines, vaccines, seeds, pesticides) that can help their target audiences. Data is central to these purposes, but unfortunately, like most things, it’s not quite so simple.\nIn data science, we have become used to situations where you have massive amounts of data that are available to you for mining and exploring, typically from tech giants, cloud providers and fintech. Data in the life sciences is much more limited; a drug can be approved with as few as 1000 patients in a clinical trial. Data is both harder and more expensive to collect, and so we are often much more careful about how we collect and utilize data.\nThe purpose to which we use the data is also quite different. Most data science applications you may encounter revolve around predictive modeling, where the intent is to create robust predictions even if the model is a black box; we don’t really care how the predictions are generated but rather whether the predictions are accurate or robust. In the life sciences, we’re often more interested in what factors influence the prediction, why we see the patterns we see, and can the patterns be attributable to a set of factors either observable or imposed. So the currency we deal with involves correlations, associations and causality. We’re interested to get an understanding of how Nature works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two cultures\n\n\n\nLeo Breiman, in 2001, wrote a seminal and influential paper, “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures”, where he distinguished between data models (classical statistical models) and algorithmic models (what we now call ‘black box’ predictive models). This is an important distinction to understand, since they require different mental models to work with, and different arrangements of the data, and are also interpreted and evaluated differently.\nPerhaps you saw this distinction in the materials for DSAN 5000 and DSAN 5100.",

We’ll introduce some new distributions that will be used in the class\n\nA.2.1 Exponential distribution\nThe exponential distribution has one parameter, usually denoted by \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\) , which is also the mean of the distribution. If \\(X\\sim Exp(\\lambda)\\), then\n\\[\nP(X &gt; x) = e^{-\\lambda x}\\quad \\text{for } x &gt; 0\n\\]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nA.2.2 Weibull distribution\nThe Weibull distribution is a generalization of the Exponential distribution. It is a two-parameter distribution, with the parameters called shape (\\(\\alpha\\)) and scale ( \\(\\beta\\) ). For this distribution,\n\\[\nP(X &gt; x ) = e^{-(x/\\beta)^\\alpha}\n\\]\nNotice that the Exponential distribution is a special case with \\(\\alpha = 1\\) and \\(\\beta\\) = \\(1/\\lambda\\)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nA.2.3 Gamma distribution\n\n\nA.2.4 Poisson distribution",
