This is\ntypically called the **average treatment effect (ATE)** and is a common target\nfor causal inference. Note that this doesn't just have to be a difference of the\ncounterfactual outcomes, but can also be a ratio (which is a difference on the\nlog-scale).\n\n## Randomized experiments\n\nRandomized experiments, where the exposure is *randomly allocated* to\nindividuals, is considered the gold standard for evaluating causal relationships\nand estimating causal effects. As we saw in @sec-week3, randomization breaks\ncausal paths to the exposure and so removes all backdoor paths between the\nexposure and outcome, resulting in the only evident causal pathway between the\nexposure and outcome.\n",
