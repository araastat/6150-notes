So $h(t)$ is like a derivative. In fact, let's re-write the formula as \n\n$$\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\nh(t) &=& \\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{F(t + \\Delta t) - F(t)}{\\Delta t}\\frac{1}{1-F(t)}\\\\\n&=& \\frac{1}{1-F(t)} \\frac{dF(t)}{dt}\\\\\n&=& f(t)/(1-F(t))\n\\end{eqnarray*}\n$$\nwhere $F(t) = P(T \\leq t)$ is the c.d.f., and $f(t) = dF(t)/dt$ is the p.d.f of the distribution of the followup time _T_. Turns out (if you remember basic calculus) that \n\n$$\nh(t) = -\\frac{d\\log S(t)}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $S(t) = 1-F(t)$. Because of this relationship, we can define the cumulative hazard \n\n$$H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u)du = -\\log S(t)$$\nand the inverse relationship between the survival and hazard functions is \n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t h(u)du\\right) = \\exp(-H(t))\n$$\n\nThe hazard function is another way of defining the probability distribution of _T_, since there is a 1:1 relationship between $h(t)$ and $F(t)$ based on the equations above\n\n### Conditioning on time lived\nSurvival models can help predict the future; what is the chance of dying in _x_ years, given one has lived 50 years, say",
