  {"id":"_2023b","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have gained considerable interest across diverse research communities. Their notable ability for text completion and generation has inaugurated a novel paradigm for language-interfaced problem solving. However, the potential and efficacy of these models in bioinformatics remain incompletely explored. In this work, we study the performance GPT variants on a wide spectrum of crucial bioinformatics tasks. These tasks include the identification of potential coding regions, extraction of named entities for genes and proteins, detection of antimicrobial and anti-cancer peptides, molecular optimization, and resolution of educational bioinformatics problems. Our findings indicate that, given appropriate prompts, LLMs like GPT variants can successfully handle most of these tasks. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of their limitations in the context of complicated bioinformatics tasks. We envision this work to provide new perspectives and motivate future research in the field of both LLM applications and bioinformatics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"citation-key":"_2023b","container-title":"Transactions on Machine Learning Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"language":"en","source":"openreview.net","title":"An Evaluation of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=cCT9cJxj0h"},

Identifying patients likely to respond or not respond to TNFis could provide opportunities to personalize treatment strategies.To develop models of the probability of short-term response to TNFi treatment in individual patients with active AS.This is a retrospective cohort study using data of the TNFi group (ie, treatment group) from 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of TNFi treatment among patients with active AS, conducted from 2002 to 2016. Participants were adult patients with active AS who failed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Included RCTs were phase 3 and 4 studies that assessed the efficacy of an originator TNFi at week 12 and/or week 24, either compared with placebo or an antirheumatic drug. The cohort was divided into a training and a testing set. Data analysis was conducted from July 1, 2019, to November 30, 2020.All included patients received an originator TNFi for at least 12 weeks.Outcomes included major response and no response based on the change of AS Disease Activity Score at 12 weeks. Machine learning algorithms were applied to estimate the probability of having major response and no response for individual patients.The study included 1899 participants from 10 trials. The training set included 1207 individuals (mean [SD] age, 39 [12] years; 908 [75.2\n%] men), of whom 407 (33.7\n%) had major response and 414 (34.3\n%) had no response. In the reduced logistic regression models, accuracy was 0.74 for major response and 0.75 for no response. The probability of major response increased with higher C-reactive protein (CRP) level, patient global assessment (PGA), and Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) question 2 score and decreased with higher body mass index (BMI) and Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI) score. The probability of no response increased with age and BASFI score, and decreased with higher CRP level, BASDAI question 2 score, and PGA. In the testing set (692 participants; mean [SD] age, 38 [11] years; 533 [77.0\n%] men), models demonstrated moderate to high accuracy.In this cohort study, the probability of initial response to TNFi was predicted from baseline variables, which may facilitate personalized treatment decision-making.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Runsheng"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M."}],"citation-key":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2312","container-title":"JAMA Network Open","DOI":"10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2312","ISSN":"2574-3805","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"page":"e222312-e222312","title":"Predicting probability of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for individual patients with ankylosing spondylitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.2312","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"Aalen2012a","abstract":"Summary. Time dynamics are often ignored in causal modelling. Clearly, causality must operate in time and we show how this corresponds to a mechanistic, or system, understanding of causality. The established counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects depend on an ability to manipulate the mediator which may not hold in practice, and we argue that a mechanistic view may be better. Graphical representations based on local independence graphs and dynamic path analysis are used to facilitate communication as well as providing an overview of the dynamic relations 'at a glance'. The relationship between causality as understood in a mechanistic and in an interventionist sense is discussed. An example using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study is presented.","author":[{"family":"Aalen","given":"Odd O"},{"family":"Røysland","given":"Kjetil"},{"family":"Gran","given":"Jon Michael"},{"family":"Ledergerber","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"Aalen2012a","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"number":"4","page":"831-861","publisher":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Causality, mediation and time: a dynamic viewpoint.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pubget.com/site/paper/23193356?institution=","volume":"175"},
  {"id":"aalenArmitageLecture20102012","abstract":"There is a single-minded focus on events in survival analysis, and we often ignore longitudinal data that are collected together with the event data. This is due to a lack of methodology but also a result of the artificial distinction between survival and longitudinal data analyses. Understanding the dynamics of such processes is important but has been hampered by a lack of appreciation of the difference between confirmatory and exploratory causal inferences. The latter represents an attempt at elucidating mechanisms by applying mediation analysis to statistical data and will usually be of a more tentative character than a confirmatory analysis. The concept of local independence and the associated graphs are useful. This is related to Granger causality, an important method from econometrics that is generally undervalued by statisticians. This causality concept is different from the counterfactual one since it lacks lacks the intervention aspect. The notion that one can intervene at will in naturally occurring processes, which seems to underly much of modern causal inference, is problematic when studying mediation and mechanisms. It is natural to assume a stochastic process point of view when analyzing dynamic relationships. We present some examples to illustrate this. It is not clear how survival analysis must be developed to handle the complex life-history data that are increasingly being collected today. We give some suggestions.

A large percentage of this population is afflicted with multiple acute diseases (multi-morbidity). Clinicians need new tools to quantify the relative risk of an adverse event due to each competing disease and prioritize treatment among various diseases affecting a patient. Currently available deep learning survival analysis models have limited ability to incorporate multiple risks. Also, deep learning survival analysis models in current literature work predominantly in the discrete-time domain, while all biochemical processes continuously happen in the body. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture for a continuous-time deep learning model to combat these two issues, DeepCompete, aimed at survival analysis for competing risks. Our model learns the risk of each disease in an entirely data-driven fashion without making strong assumptions about the underlying stochastic processes. Further, we demonstrate that our model has superior results compared to state of the art continuous-time statistical models for survival analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Aastha","given":""},{"family":"Huang","given":"Pengyu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yan"}],"citation-key":"aasthaDeepCompeteDeepLearning2021","container-title":"AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings","container-title-short":"AMIA Annu Symp Proc","ISSN":"1942-597X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,25]]},"page":"177-186","PMCID":"PMC8075516","PMID":"33936389","source":"PubMed Central","title":"DeepCompete : A deep learning approach to competing risks in continuous time domain","title-short":"DeepCompete","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8075516/","volume":"2020"},

This Review summarizes translational implications of data supporting ctDNA-based risk determination in NSCLC and outstanding questions regarding ctDNA validity/utility as a prognostic biomarker. We discuss emerging ctDNA capabilities to refine clinical tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) staging in lung adenocarcinoma, ctDNA dynamics during neoadjuvant therapy for identifying patients deriving suboptimal benefit, and postoperative molecular residual disease (MRD) detection to escalate systemic therapy. Considering differential relapse characteristics in landmark MRD-negative/MRD-positive patients, we propose how ctDNA might integrate with pathological response data for optimal postoperative risk stratification.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbosh","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Doherty","given":"Gary J."},{"family":"Gale","given":"Davina"},{"family":"Black","given":"James R.

For 128 patients treated with a first-line next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI; abiraterone or enzalutamide), we examined the association of 18 recurrent DNA- and RNA-based genomic alterations, including androgen receptor (AR) variant expression, AR transcriptional output, and neuroendocrine expression signatures, with clinical outcomes. Of these, only RB1 alteration was significantly associated with poor survival, whereas alterations in RB1, AR, and TP53 were associated with shorter time on treatment with an ARSI.

As a result, it is critical that the transcriptional phenotypes discovered are defined and disseminated in a consistent and concise manner. Molecular biomarkers have historically played an important role in biological research, from defining immune cell types by surface protein expression to defining diseases by their molecular drivers. Here we describe a machine learning-based marker gene selection algorithm, NS-Forest version 2.0, which leverages the nonlinear attributes of random forest feature selection and a binary expression scoring approach to discover the minimal marker gene expression combinations that optimally captures the cell type identity represented in complete scRNA-seq transcriptional profiles. The marker genes selected provide an expression barcode that serves as both a useful tool for downstream biological investigation and the necessary and sufficient characteristics for semantic cell type definition. The use of NS-Forest to identify marker genes for human brain middle temporal gyrus cell types reveals the importance of cell signaling and noncoding RNAs in neuronal cell type identity.","author":[{"family":"Aevermann","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Novotny","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Keshk","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Bakken","given":"Trygve E."},{"family":"Miller","given":"Jeremy A."},{"family":"Hodge","given":"Rebecca D."},{"family":"Lelieveldt","given":"Boudewijn P.

  {"id":"Agunbiade:2020","abstract":"Racial and ethnic minorities, particularly blacks, survive longer on maintenance dialysis than whites. Minorities are also less likely to discontinue dialysis, which affects relative survival. Both differences have been attributed by some clinicians to better health among minorities on dialysis. To test if health differences explain racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation, the authors compared the frequency of dialysis discontinuation among racial and ethnic groups after hospitalization for one of four serious medical conditions. Despite hospitalization for the same condition, racial and ethnic minorities were less likely than whites to discontinue dialysis. Using a simulation that accounted for differences in dialysis discontinuation substantially reduced the survival advantage of racial and ethnic minorities. The study suggests that racial and ethnic differences in survival were largely determined by differential discontinuation of dialysis.Background Racial and ethnic minorities on dialysis survive longer than whites, and are less likely to discontinue dialysis. Both differences have been attributed by some clinicians to better health among minorities on dialysis.Methods To test if racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation reflected better health, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of survival and dialysis discontinuation among patients on maintenance dialysis in the US Renal Data System after hospitalization for either stroke (n=60,734), lung cancer (n=4100), dementia (n=40,084), or failure to thrive (n=42,950) between 2003 and 2014. We examined the frequency of discontinuation of dialysis and used simulations to estimate survival in minorities relative to whites if minorities had the same pattern of dialysis discontinuation as whites.Results Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians had substantially lower frequencies of dialysis discontinuation than whites in each hospitalization cohort. Observed risks of mortality were also lower for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. In simulations that assigned discontinuation patterns similar to those found among whites across racial and ethnic groups, differences in survival were markedly attenuated and hazard ratios approached 1.0. Survival and dialysis discontinuation frequencies among American Indians and Alaska Natives were close to those of whites.Conclusions Racial and ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation were present among patients hospitalized with similar health events. Among these patients, survival differences between racial and ethnic minorities and whites were largely attributable to differences in the frequency of discontinuation of dialysis.","author":[{"family":"Agunbiade","given":"Abdulkareem"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M."}],"citation-key":"Agunbiade:2020","container-title":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology","DOI":"10.1681/ASN.2019020122","ISSN":"1046-6673","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"page":"149-160","PMID":"31836625","publisher":"American Society of Nephrology","title":"Racial/ethnic differences in dialysis discontinuation and survival after hospitalization for serious conditions among patients on maintenance dialysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/31/1/149","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"al-mekhlafi_2022","abstract":"High throughput technologies like microarrays, next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry enable the measurement of tens of thousands of biomarker candidates in pilot studies. Biological systems are often too complex to be based on simple single cause-effect associations and from the medical practice point of view, a single biomarker may not possess the desired sensitivity and/or specificity for disease classification and outcome prediction. Therefore, the efforts of researchers currently aims at combining biomarkers. The intention of biomarker pilot studies with small sample sizes is often to explore the possibility of finding good biomarker combinations and not to find and evaluate a final combination of biomarkers with high predictive value. The aim of the pilot study is to answer the question whether it is worthwhile to extend the study to a larger study and to obtain information about the required sample size. In this paper, we propose a method to judge the potential in a small biomarker pilot study without the need to explicitly identifying and confirming a specific subset of biomarkers. In addition, we provide a method for sample size estimation for an extended study when the results of the pilot study look promising.

However, the contrast between predictive and prognostic biomarkers can be challenging due to the overlap between the two. A prognostic biomarker predicts the future outcome of cancer, regardless of treatment, and a predictive biomarker predicts the effectiveness of a therapeutic intervention. Misclassifying a prognostic biomarker as predictive (or vice versa) can have serious financial and personal consequences for patients. To address this issue, various statistical and machine learning approaches have been developed. The aim of this study is to present an in-depth analysis of recent advancements, trends, challenges, and future prospects in biomarker identification. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed to identify relevant studies published between 2017 and 2023. The selected studies were analyzed to better understand the concept of biomarker identification, evaluate machine learning methods, assess the level of research activity, and highlight the application of these methods in cancer research and treatment. Furthermore, existing obstacles and concerns are discussed to identify prospective research areas. We believe that this review will serve as a valuable resource for researchers, providing insights into the methods and approaches used in biomarker discovery and identifying future research opportunities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Al-Tashi","given":"Qasem"},{"family":"Saad","given":"Maliazurina B."},{"family":"Muneer","given":"Amgad"},{"family":"Qureshi","given":"Rizwan"},{"family":"Mirjalili","given":"Seyedali"},{"family":"Sheshadri","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Le","given":"Xiuning"},{"family":"Vokes","given":"Natalie I."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianjun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jia"}],"citation-key":"al-tashiMachineLearningModels2023","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/ijms24097781","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"7781","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Machine Learning Models for the Identification of Prognostic and Predictive Cancer Biomarkers: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Machine Learning Models for the Identification of Prognostic and Predictive Cancer Biomarkers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/9/7781","volume":"24"},

Machine learning technologies can enable accurate prognostication of patient outcomes under different treatment options by modelling complex interactions between risk factors in a data-driven fashion. Here, we use an automated and interpretable machine learning algorithm to develop a breast cancer prognostication and treatment benefit prediction model—Adjutorium—using data from large-scale cohorts of nearly one million women captured in the national cancer registries of the United Kingdom and the United States. We trained and internally validated the Adjutorium model on 395,862 patients from the UK National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), and then externally validated the model among 571,635 patients from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programme. Adjutorium exhibited significantly improved accuracy compared to the major prognostic tool in current clinical use (PREDICT v2.1) in both internal and external validation. Importantly, our model substantially improved accuracy in specific subgroups known to be under-served by existing models. Adjutorium is currently implemented as a web-based decision support tool (https://vanderschaar-lab.com/adjutorium/) to aid decisions on adjuvant therapy in women with early breast cancer, and can be publicly accessed by patients and clinicians worldwide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Alaa","given":"Ahmed M."},{"family":"Gurdasani","given":"Deepti"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Adrian L."},{"family":"Rashbass","given":"Jem"},{"family":"Schaar","given":"Mihaela","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"alaaMachineLearningGuide2021","container-title":"Nature Machine Intelligence","container-title-short":"Nat Mach Intell","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-021-00353-8","ISSN":"2522-5839","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,24]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Breast cancer;Prognosis\nSubject_term_id: breast-cancer;prognosis","page":"1-11","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Machine learning to guide the use of adjuvant therapies for breast cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00353-8"},

We use a random effects accelerated failure time model for survival outcomes, a linear mixed model for continuous longitudinal outcomes and a proportional odds mixed model for ordinal longitudinal outcomes, where these outcome processes are linked through a set of association parameters. A primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of association parameters on the estimators of joint models. The model parameters are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood. The finite-sample properties of the estimators are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. The empirical study suggests that the degree of association among the outcome processes influences the bias, efficiency, and coverage probability of the estimators. Our proposed joint model estimators are approximately unbiased and produce smaller mean squared errors as compared to the estimators obtained from separate models.

An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an unknown cell based on its transcriptional profile; and clearly, the ability to accurately predict a cell type and any pathologic-related state will play a critical role in the early diagnosis of disease and decisions around the personalized treatment for patients. Here we present a new generalizable method (\n            scPred\n            ) for prediction of cell type(s), using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning classification.\n            scPred\n            solves several problems associated with the identification of individual gene feature selection, and is able to capture subtle effects of many genes, increasing the overall variance explained by the model, and correspondingly improving the prediction accuracy. We validate the performance of\n            scPred\n            by performing experiments to classify tumor versus non-tumor epithelial cells in gastric cancer, then using independent molecular techniques (cyclic immunohistochemistry) to confirm our prediction, achieving an accuracy of classifying the disease state of individual cells of 99%.

We further implemented three dataset size reduction scenarios on two large datasets and analyze the performance of the models when trained on each resulting dataset with respect to accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Our results indicated that the overall performance of classifiers depend on how much a dataset represents the original distribution rather than its size.

  {"id":"alvaresTractableBayesianJoint2021","abstract":"We introduce a numerically tractable formulation of Bayesian joint models for longitudinal and survival data. The longitudinal process is modelled using generalised linear mixed models, while the survival process is modelled using a parametric general hazard structure. The two processes are linked by sharing fixed and random effects, separating the effects that play a role at the time scale from those that affect the hazard scale. This strategy allows for the inclusion of non-linear and time-dependent effects while avoiding the need for numerical integration, which facilitates the implementation of the proposed joint model. We explore the use of flexible parametric distributions for modelling the baseline hazard function which can capture the basic shapes of interest in practice. We discuss prior elicitation based on the interpretation of the parameters. We present an extensive simulation study, where we analyse the inferential properties of the proposed models, and illustrate the trade-off between flexibility, sample size, and censoring. We also apply our proposal to two real data applications in order to demonstrate the adaptability of our formulation both in univariate time-to-event data and in a competing risks framework.

  {"id":"ameriSurvivalAnalysisBased","abstract":"Retention of students at colleges and universities has been a concern among educators for many decades. The consequences of student attrition are signiﬁcant for students, academic staﬀs and the universities. Thus, increasing student retention is a long term goal of any academic institution. The most vulnerable students are the freshman, who are at the highest risk of dropping out at the beginning of their study. Therefore, the early identiﬁcation of “at-risk” students is a crucial task that needs to be eﬀectively addressed. In this paper, we develop a survival analysis framework for early prediction of student dropout using Cox proportional hazards model (Cox). We also applied time-dependent Cox (TD-Cox), which captures time-varying factors and can leverage those information to provide more accurate prediction of student dropout. Our model utilizes diﬀerent groups of variables such as demographic, family background, ﬁnancial, high school information, college enrollment and semester-wise credits. The proposed framework has the ability to address the challenge of predicting dropout students as well as the semester that the dropout will occur. This study enables us to perform proactive interventions in a prioritized manner where limited academic resources are available. This is critical in the student retention problem because not only correctly classifying whether a student is going to dropout is important but also when this is going to happen is crucial for a focused intervention. We evaluate our method on real student data collected at Wayne State University. Results show that the proposed Cox-based framework can predict the student dropouts and semester of dropout with high accuracy and precision compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.","author":[{"family":"Ameri","given":"Sattar"},{"family":"Chinnam","given":"Ratna B"},{"family":"Fard","given":"Mahtab J"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Chandan K"}],"citation-key":"ameriSurvivalAnalysisBased","language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"Survival Analysis based Framework for Early Prediction of Student Dropouts","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"amrhein_2019","abstract":"Abstract Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Amrhein","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Trafimow","given":"David"},{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"}],"citation-key":"amrhein_2019","container-title":"The American Statistician","container-title-short":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137","ISSN":"0003-1305, 1537-2731","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"language":"en","page":"262-270","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics: There Is No Replication Crisis if We Don’t Expect Replication","title-short":"Inferential Statistics as Descriptive Statistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137","volume":"73"},
  {"id":"andersenCompetingRisksEpidemiology2012","abstract":"Background In studies of all-cause mortality, the fundamental epidemiological concepts of rate and risk are connected through a well-defined one-to-one relation. An important consequence of this relation is that regression models such as the proportional hazards model that are defined through the hazard (the rate) immediately dictate how the covariates relate to the survival function (the risk).Methods This introductory paper reviews the concepts of rate and risk and their one-to-one relation in all-cause mortality studies and introduces the analogous concepts of rate and risk in the context of competing risks, the cause-specific hazard and the cause-specific cumulative incidence function.Results The key feature of competing risks is that the one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence, between rate and risk, is lost. This fact has two important implications. First, the naïve Kaplan–Meier that takes the competing events as censored observations, is biased. Secondly, the way in which covariates are associated with the cause-specific hazards may not coincide with the way these covariates are associated with the cumulative incidence. An example with relapse and non-relapse mortality as competing risks in a stem cell transplantation study is used for illustration.Conclusion The two implications of the loss of one-to-one correspondence between cause-specific hazard and cumulative incidence should be kept in mind when deciding on how to make inference in a competing risks situation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Per Kragh"},{"family":"Geskus","given":"Ronald B"},{"family":"Witte","given":"Theo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Putter","given":"Hein"}],"citation-key":"andersenCompetingRisksEpidemiology2012","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyr213","ISSN":"0300-5771","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"page":"861-870","source":"Silverchair","title":"Competing risks in epidemiology: possibilities and pitfalls","title-short":"Competing risks in epidemiology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyr213","volume":"41"},

Our aim is to utilize the available follow-up measurements of the current patients to produce dynamically updated predictions of both survival and freedom from re-intervention for future patients. In this paper, we propose to jointly model multiple longitudinal measurements combined with competing risk survival outcomes and derive the dynamically updated cumulative incidence functions. Moreover, we investigate whether different features of the longitudinal processes would change significantly the prediction for the events of interest by considering different types of association structures, such as time-dependent trajectory slopes and time-dependent cumulative effects. Our final contribution focuses on optimizing the quality of the derived predictions.

The motivation for our research comes from a study which includes patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. These patients are followed prospectively over time by standardized echocardiographic assessment of valve function. Loss of follow-up could be caused by valve intervention or the death of the patient. One of the main characteristics of the human valve is that its durability is limited. Therefore, it is of interest to obtain a prognostic model in order for the physicians to scan trends in valve function over time and plan their next intervention, accounting for the characteristics of the data. Several authors have focused on deriving predictions under the standard joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data framework that assumes a constant effect for the coefficient that links the longitudinal and survival outcomes. However, in our case, this may be a restrictive assumption. Since the valve degenerates, the association between the biomarker with survival may change over time. To improve dynamic predictions, we propose a Bayesian joint model that allows a time-varying coefficient to link the longitudinal and the survival processes, using P-splines. We evaluate the performance of the model in terms of discrimination and calibration, while accounting for censoring.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrinopoulou","given":"Eleni-Rosalina"},{"family":"Eilers","given":"Paul H.

  {"id":"andrinopoulouIntegratingLatentClasses2020","abstract":"Cystic fibrosis is a chronic lung disease requiring frequent lung-function monitoring to track acute respiratory events (pulmonary exacerbations). The association between lung-function trajectory and time-to-first exacerbation can be characterized using joint longitudinal-survival modeling. Joint models specified through the shared parameter framework quantify the strength of association between such outcomes but do not incorporate latent sub-populations reflective of heterogeneous disease progression. Conversely, latent class joint models explicitly postulate the existence of sub-populations but do not directly quantify the strength of association. Furthermore, choosing the optimal number of classes using established metrics like deviance information criterion is computationally intensive in complex models. To overcome these limitations, we integrate latent classes in the shared parameter joint model through a fully Bayesian approach. To choose the optimal number of classes, we construct a mixture model assuming more latent classes than present in the data, thereby asymptotically ?emptying? superfluous latent classes, provided the Dirichlet prior on class proportions is sufficiently uninformative. Model properties are evaluated in simulation studies. Application to data from the US Cystic Fibrosis Registry supports the existence of three sub-populations corresponding to lung-function trajectories with high initial forced expiratory volume in 1?s (FEV1), rapid FEV1 decline, and low but steady FEV1 progression. The association between FEV1 and hazard of exacerbation was negative in each class, but magnitude varied.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Andrinopoulou","given":"Eleni-Rosalina"},{"family":"Nasserinejad","given":"Kazem"},{"family":"Szczesniak","given":"Rhonda"},{"family":"Rizopoulos","given":"Dimitris"}],"citation-key":"andrinopoulouIntegratingLatentClasses2020","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/0962280220924680","ISSN":"0962-2802","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,1]]},"page":"3294-3307","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Integrating latent classes in the Bayesian shared parameter joint model of longitudinal and survival outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280220924680","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"andrinopoulouJointModelingTwo2014","abstract":"AbstractAortic gradient and aortic regurgitation are echocardiographic markers of aortic valve function. Both are biomarkers repeatedly measured in patients with valve abnormalities, and thus, it is expected that they are biologically interrelated. Loss of follow-up could be caused by multiple reasons, including valve progression related, such as an intervention or even the death of the patient. In that case, it would be of interest and appropriate to analyze these outcomes jointly. Joint models have recently received much attention because they cover a wide range of clinical applications and have promising results. We propose a joint model consisting of two longitudinal outcomes, one continuous (aortic gradient) and one ordinal (aortic regurgitation), and two time-to-events (death and reoperation). Moreover, we allow for more flexibility for the average evolution and the subject-specific profiles of the continuous repeated outcome by using B-splines. A disadvantage, however, is that when adopting a non-linear structure for the model, we may have difficulties when interpreting the results. To overcome this problem, we propose a graphical approach. In this paper, we apply the proposed joint models under the Bayesian framework, using a data set including serial echocardiographic measurements of aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation and measurements of the occurrence of death and reoperation in patients who received a human tissue valve in the aortic position. The interpretation of the results will be discussed.

  {"id":"Arends2008","abstract":"The use of standard univariate fixed- and random-effects models in meta-analysis has become well known in the last 20 years. However, these models are unsuitable for meta-analysis of clinical trials that present multiple survival estimates (usually illustrated by a survival curve) during a follow-up period. Therefore, special methods are needed to combine the survival curve data from different trials in a meta-analysis. For this purpose, only fixed-effects models have been suggested in the literature. In this paper, we propose a multivariate random-effects model for joint analysis of survival proportions reported at multiple time points and in different studies, to be combined in a meta-analysis. The model could be seen as a generalization of the fixed-effects model of Dear (Biometrics 1994; 50:989-1002). We illustrate the method by using a simulated data example as well as using a clinical data example of meta-analysis with aggregated survival curve data.

  {"id":"asarDynamicPredictionsKidney2019","abstract":"Dynamic predictions of survival outcomes are of great interest to physicians and patients, since such predictions are useful elements of clinical decision-making. Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data has been increasingly used to obtain dynamic predictions. A common assumption of joint modelling is that random-effects and error terms in the longitudinal sub-model are Gaussian. However, this assumption may be too restrictive, e.g. in the presence of outliers as commonly encountered in many real-life applications. A natural extension is to robustify the joint models by assuming more flexible distributions than Gaussian for the random-effects and/or error terms. Previous research reported improved performance of robust joint models compared to the Gaussian version in terms of parameter estimation, but dynamic prediction accuracy obtained from such approach has not been yet evaluated. In this study, we define a general robust joint model with t-distributed random-effects and error terms under a Bayesian paradigm. Dynamic predictions of graft failure were obtained for kidney transplant recipients from the French transplant cohort, DIVAT. Calibration and discrimination performances of Gaussian and robust joint models were compared for a validation sample. Dynamic predictions for two individuals are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Asar","given":"Ozgur"},{"family":"Fournier","given":"Marie-Cecile"},{"family":"Dantan","given":"Etienne"}],"citation-key":"asarDynamicPredictionsKidney2019","container-title":"arXiv:1905.00816 [stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Dynamic predictions of kidney graft survival in the presence of longitudinal outliers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00816"},
  {"id":"asarJointModellingRepeated2015","abstract":"Backgound: The term 'joint modelling' is used in the statistical literature to refer to meth-ods for simultaneously analysing longitudinal measurement outcomes, also called repeated measurement data, and time-to-event outcomes, also called survival data. A typical example from nephrology is a study in which the data from each participant consist of repeated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements and time to initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Joint models typically combine linear mixed effects models for repeated measurements and Cox models for censored survival outcomes. Our aim in this paper is to present an introductory tutorial on joint modelling methods, with a case study in nephrology. Methods: We describe the development of the joint modelling framework and compare the results with those obtained by the more widely used approaches of conducting sep-arate analyses of the repeated measurements and survival times based on a linear mixed effects model and a Cox model, respectively. Our case study concerns a data set from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study (CRISIS). We also pro-vide details of our open-source software implementation to allow others to replicate and/ or modify our analysis. Results: The results for the conventional linear mixed effects model and the longitudinal component of the joint models were found to be similar. However, there were consider-able differences between the results for the Cox model with time-varying covariate and the time-to-event component of the joint model. For example, the relationship between kidney function as measured by eGFR and the hazard for initiation of RRT was signifi-cantly underestimated by the Cox model that treats eGFR as a time-varying covariate, because the Cox model does not take measurement error in eGFR into account. Conclusions: Joint models should be preferred for simultaneous analyses of repeated measurement and survival data, especially when the former is measured with error and the association between the underlying error-free measurement process and the hazard for survival is of scientific interest.","author":[{"family":"Asar","given":"Özgür"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"James"},{"family":"Kalra","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Diggle","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"asarJointModellingRepeated2015","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyu262","ISBN":"0300-5771","ISSN":"14643685","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"number":"1","PMID":"25604450","title":"Joint modelling of repeated measurement and time-to-event data: An introductory tutorial","type":"article-journal","volume":"44"},

First, replicable but flexible feature engineering procedures translate genome-scale data into biologically informative features that appropriately contextualize simple variant calls/genotypes within biological and functional contexts. Second, model-free, nonparametric ML-based feature filtering procedures empirically reduce dimensionality and noise of both original genotype calls and engineered features. Third, a powerful ML algorithm for feature selection is used to differentiate risk variant contributions across variant frequency and functional prediction spectra. The TM simultaneously evaluates potential contributions of variants operative under polygenic and heterogeneous models of genetic architecture. Our TM enables integration of biological information (e.g., genomic annotations) within conceptual frameworks akin to geneset-/pathways-based and collapsing methods, but overcomes some of these methods' limitations.

  {"id":"austin:2008","abstract":"The propensity score is defined to be a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. In the medical literature, there are three commonly employed propensity-score methods: stratification (subclassification) on the propensity score, matching on the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. Methods have been developed to assess the adequacy of the propensity score model in the context of stratification on the propensity score and propensity-score matching. However, no comparable methods have been developed for covariate adjustment using the propensity score. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score methods are only valid if, conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of baseline covariates. We develop both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the balance in baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects. The quantitative method employs the weighted conditional standardized difference. This is the conditional difference in the mean of a covariate between treated and untreated subjects, in units of the pooled standard deviation, integrated over the distribution of the propensity score. The qualitative method employs quantile regression models to determine whether, conditional on the propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of continuous covariates.

  {"id":"austin:2015","abstract":"The propensity score is defined as a subject's probability of treatment selection, conditional on observed baseline covariates. Weighting subjects by the inverse probability of treatment received creates a synthetic sample in which treatment assignment is independent of measured baseline covariates. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score allows one to obtain unbiased estimates of average treatment effects. However, these estimates are only valid if there are no residual systematic differences in observed baseline characteristics between treated and control subjects in the sample weighted by the estimated inverse probability of treatment. We report on a systematic literature review, in which we found that the use of IPTW has increased rapidly in recent years, but that in the most recent year, a majority of studies did not formally examine whether weighting balanced measured covariates between treatment groups. We then proceed to describe a suite of quantitative and qualitative methods that allow one to assess whether measured baseline covariates are balanced between treatment groups in the weighted sample. The quantitative methods use the weighted standardized difference to compare means, prevalences, higher-order moments, and interactions. The qualitative methods employ graphical methods to compare the distribution of continuous baseline covariates between treated and control subjects in the weighted sample. Finally, we illustrate the application of these methods in an empirical case study. We propose a formal set of balance diagnostics that contribute towards an evolving concept of ‘best practice’ when using IPTW to estimate causal treatment effects using observational data. © 2015 The Authors.

  {"id":"austinFineGraySubdistributionHazard2021","abstract":"The Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model has become the default method to estimate the incidence of outcomes over time in the presence of competing risks. This model is attractive because it directly relates covariates to the cumulative incidence function (CIF) of the event of interest. An alternative is to combine the different cause-specific hazard functions to obtain the different CIFs. A limitation of the subdistribution hazard approach is that the sum of the cause-specific CIFs can exceed 1 (100%) for some covariate patterns. Using data on 9479 patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction, we estimated the cumulative incidence of both cardiovascular death and non-cardiovascular death for each patient. We found that when using subdistribution hazard models, approximately 5% of subjects had an estimated risk of 5-year all-cause death (obtained by combining the two cause-specific CIFs obtained from subdistribution hazard models) that exceeded 1. This phenomenon was avoided by using the two cause-specific hazard models. We provide a proof that the sum of predictions exceeds 1 is a fundamental problem with the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model. We further explored this issue using simulations based on two different types of data-generating process, one based on subdistribution hazard models and other based on cause-specific hazard models. We conclude that care should be taken when using the Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard model in situations with wide risk distributions or a high cumulative incidence, and if one is interested in the risk of failure from each of the different event types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Steyerberg","given":"Ewout W."},{"family":"Putter","given":"Hein"}],"citation-key":"austinFineGraySubdistributionHazard2021","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.9023","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"4200-4212","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models to simultaneously estimate the absolute risk of different event types: Cumulative total failure probability may exceed 1","title-short":"Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models to simultaneously estimate the absolute risk of different event types","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9023","volume":"40"},

We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the performance of these calibration measures when the underlying model has been correctly specified and under different types of model mis‐specification. We illustrate the utility of calibration curves and the three calibration metrics by using them to compare the calibration of a Cox proportional hazards regression model with that of a random survival forest for predicting mortality in patients hospitalized with heart failure. Under a correctly specified regression model, differences between the two methods for constructing calibration curves were minimal, although the performance of the method based on restricted cubic splines tended to be slightly better. In contrast, under a mis‐specified model, the smoothed calibration curved constructed using hazard regression tended to be closer to the true calibration curve. The use of calibration curves and of these numeric calibration metrics permits for a comprehensive comparison of the calibration of competing survival models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Harrell","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Klaveren","given":"David","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"austinGraphicalCalibrationCurves2020a","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","container-title-short":"Stat Med","DOI":"10.1002/sim.8570","ISSN":"0277-6715","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,20]]},"page":"2714-2742","PMCID":"PMC7497089","PMID":"32548928","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Graphical calibration curves and the integrated calibration index (ICI) for survival models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497089/","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"austinPracticalRecommendationsReporting2017","abstract":"In survival analysis, a competing risk is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. Outcomes in medical research are frequently subject to competing risks. In survival analysis, there are 2 key questions that can be addressed using competing risk regression models: first, which covariates affect the rate at which events occur, and second, which covariates affect the probability of an event occurring over time. The cause‐specific hazard model estimates the effect of covariates on the rate at which events occur in subjects who are currently event‐free. Subdistribution hazard ratios obtained from the Fine‐Gray model describe the relative effect of covariates on the subdistribution hazard function. Hence, the covariates in this model can also be interpreted as having an effect on the cumulative incidence function or on the probability of events occurring over time. We conducted a review of the use and interpretation of the Fine‐Gray subdistribution hazard model in articles published in the medical literature in 2015. We found that many authors provided an unclear or incorrect interpretation of the regression coefficients associated with this model. An incorrect and inconsistent interpretation of regression coefficients may lead to confusion when comparing results across different studies. Furthermore, an incorrect interpretation of estimated regression coefficients can result in an incorrect understanding about the magnitude of the association between exposure and the incidence of the outcome. The objective of this article is to clarify how these regression coefficients should be reported and to propose suggestions for interpreting these coefficients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Austin","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Fine","given":"Jason P."}],"citation-key":"austinPracticalRecommendationsReporting2017","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","container-title-short":"Stat Med","DOI":"10.1002/sim.7501","ISSN":"0277-6715","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,30]]},"page":"4391-4400","PMCID":"PMC5698744","PMID":"28913837","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Practical recommendations for reporting Fine‐Gray model analyses for competing risk data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5698744/","volume":"36"},

We describe three families of regression models for the analysis of multilevel survival data. First, Cox proportional hazards models with mixed effects incorporate cluster-specific random effects that modify the baseline hazard function. Second, piecewise exponential survival models partition the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals and fit a model that assumes that the hazard function is constant within each interval. This is equivalent to a Poisson regression model that incorporates the duration of exposure within each interval. By incorporating cluster-specific random effects, generalised linear mixed models can be used to analyse these data. Third, after partitioning the duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals, one can use discrete time survival models that use a complementary log–log generalised linear model to model the occurrence of the outcome of interest within each interval. Random effects can be incorporated to account for within-cluster homogeneity in outcomes. We illustrate the application of these methods using data consisting of patients hospitalised with a heart attack.

Pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0N0) and downstaging (<ypT2N0) are associated with long term survival in patients with MIBC. Several trials have evaluated neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NAI) and chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) for MIBC. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of available trials to compare the incidence of pathological response with NAC, NAI and NACI in MIBC patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Methods: Phase II/III clinical trials assessing neoadjuvant systemic therapies (NAC, NAI, or NACI) in patients with MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy were identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE. Outcomes of interest included pCR and pathological downstaging. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled incidence of events using the Freeman-Tukey transformation. Clopper-Pearson method was used to estimate the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of the 5357 records initially identified, 28 trials with a total of 2138 patients were considered eligible for inclusion. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in 15 trials (1535 patients), NAI in 5 (288 patients), and NACI in 8 (315 patients). The pooled incidence of patients experiencing a pCR was 30.91% (95% CI: 26.54%-35.45%) with NAC, 30.92% (23.22%-39.14%) with NAI, and 42.25% (36.6%-48.0%) with NACI. The difference in pCR among these therapies was statistically significant (p <0.05). Similarly, the pooled incidence of achieving pathological downstaging was 40.91% (34.26%-47.72%) with NAC, 38.84% (26.73%-51.64%) with NAI, and 62.88% (57.22%-68.39%) with NACI. Consistently, there was statistically significant effect modification by the choice of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (p <0.01). The results were consistent across different clinically important subgroups (Table). Conclusions: NACI may achieve better pCR and pathological downstaging than NAC and NAI alone in MIBC patients which may potentially be associated with long-term survival.

  {"id":"bafetaAnalysisSystematicReviews2013","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether network meta-analyses, increasingly used to assess comparative effectiveness of healthcare interventions, follow the key methodological recommendations for reporting and conduct of systematic reviews.\n\nDESIGN: Methodological systematic review of reports of network meta-analyses.\n\nDATA SOURCES: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Medline, and Embase, searched from inception to 12 July 2012.\n\nREVIEW METHODS: All network meta-analyses comparing clinical efficacy of three or more interventions based on randomised controlled trials, excluding meta-analyses with an open loop network of three interventions. We assessed the reporting of general characteristics and key methodological components of the systematic review process using two composite outcomes. For some components, if reporting was adequate, we assessed their conduct quality.\n\nRESULTS: Of 121 network meta-analyses covering a wide range of medical areas, 100 (83%) assessed pharmacological interventions and 11 (9%) non-pharmacological interventions; 56 (46%) were published in journals with a high impact factor. The electronic search strategy for each database was not reported in 88 (73%) network meta-analyses; for 36 (30%), the primary outcome was not clearly identified. Overall, 61 (50%) network meta-analyses did not report any information regarding the assessment of risk of bias of individual studies, and 103 (85%) did not report any methods to assess the likelihood of publication bias. Overall, 87 (72%) network meta-analyses did not report the literature search, searched only one database, did not search other sources, or did not report an assessment of risk of bias of individual studies. These methodological components did not differ by publication in a general or specialty journal or by public or private funding.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Essential methodological components of the systematic review process-conducting a literature search and assessing risk of bias of individual studies-are frequently lacking in reports of network meta-analyses, even when published in journals with high impact factors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bafeta","given":"Aïda"},{"family":"Trinquart","given":"Ludovic"},{"family":"Seror","given":"Raphaèle"},{"family":"Ravaud","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"bafetaAnalysisSystematicReviews2013","container-title":"BMJ (Clinical research ed.)","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.f3675","ISSN":"1756-1833","issue":"jul01_1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1,1]]},"number":"jul01_1","page":"f3675","PMID":"23818558","title":"Analysis of the systematic reviews process in reports of network meta-analyses: methodological systematic review.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f3675.long","volume":"347"},

Data processing, however, is often not described well enough to allow for exact reproduction of the results, leading to exercises in “forensic bioinformatics” where aspects of raw data and reported results are used to infer what methods must have been employed. Unfortunately, poor documentation can shift from an inconvenience to an active danger when it obscures not just methods but errors. In this report we examine several related papers purporting to use microarray-based signatures of drug sensitivity derived from cell lines to predict patient response. Patients in clinical trials are currently being allocated to treatment arms on the basis of these results. However, we show in five case studies that the results incorporate several simple errors that may be putting patients at risk. One theme that emerges is that the most common errors are simple (e.g., row or column offsets); conversely, it is our experience that the most simple errors are common. We then discuss steps we are taking to avoid such errors in our own investigations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Baggerly","given":"Keith A."},{"family":"Coombes","given":"Kevin R."}],"citation-key":"baggerly:2009","container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/09-AOAS291","ISSN":"1932-6157, 1941-7330","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"page":"1309-1334","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Deriving chemosensitivity from cell lines: Forensic bioinformatics and reproducible research in high-throughput biology","title-short":"Deriving chemosensitivity from cell lines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-3/issue-4/Deriving-chemosensitivity-from-cell-lines--Forensic-bioinformatics-and-reproducible/10.1214/09-AOAS291.full","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"baillie:2023","abstract":"There is growing interest in data science and the challenges that scientists can solve through its application. The growing interest is in part due to the promise of “extracting value from data.” The pharmaceutical industry is no different in this regard reflected by the advancement and excitement surrounding data science. Data science brings new perspectives, new methods, new skill sets and the wider use of new data modalities. For example, there is a belief that extracting value from data integrated from multiple sources and modalities using advances in statistics, machine learning, informatics and computation can answer fundamental questions. These questions span a variety of themes including disease understanding, drug and target discovery, and trial design. By answering fundamental questions, we cannot only increase knowledge and understanding but more importantly inform decision making; accelerating drug development through data-driven prioritization, increasingly precise and accurate measurements, optimized trial designs and operational excellence. However, with the promise of data science, there are obstacles to overcome, especially if data science is to live up to this promise and deliver a positive impact. These obstacles include consensus on the definition of data science, the relationship between data science and existing fields such as statistics and computing science, what should be involved in the day-to-day practices of data science, and what is “good” practice. In this article, we cover these themes, highlighting issues with scientific practice from five perspectives and argue how advances in data science will not be immune, especially exploratory, investigative, and innovative activities. We propose a definition of data science as a coming together but also a refocusing of established disciplines leading to a framework for good practice. In doing so, we aim to begin a dialogue on good data science practice in the context of drug development, where there is no industry view or consensus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Baillie","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Moloney","given":"Conor"},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Carsten Philipp"},{"family":"Dorn","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Branson","given":"Janice"},{"family":"Ohlssen","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"baillie:2023","container-title":"Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research","DOI":"10.1080/19466315.2022.2063172","ISSN":"null","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,2]]},"page":"74-85","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Good Data Science Practice: Moving Toward a Code of Practice for Drug Development","title-short":"Good Data Science Practice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2022.2063172","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"bandini_2021","abstract":"In the PURE-01 study (NCT02736266), we aimed to evaluate the ability to predict the pathologic complete response (pT0N0) after pembrolizumab by using clinical and tumor biomarkers.In an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, 3 courses of 200 mg pembrolizumab preceding radical cystectomy were administered in patients with T2-4aN0M0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The analyses included a comprehensive genomic profiling and programmed cell-death-ligand-1 (PD-L1)–combined positive score assessment (CPS; Dako 22C3 antibody) of pre- and posttherapy samples. Multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated baseline clinical T stage and tumor biomarkers in association with pT0N0 response. Corresponding coefficients were used to develop a calculator of pT0N0 response based on the tumor mutational burden (TMB), CPS, and the clinical T stage. Decision-curve analysis was also performed. All statistical tests were 2-sided.From February 2017 to June 2019, 112 patients with biomarker data were enrolled (105 with complete TMB and CPS data). Increasing TMB and CPS values featured a linear association with logistic pT0N0 probabilities (P = .02 and P = .004, respectively). For low TMB values (≤11 mut/Mb, median value, n = 53), pT0N0 probability was not associated with increasing CPS. Conversely, for high TMB values (&gt;11 mut/Mb, n = 52), pT0N0 was statistically significantly associated with higher CPS (P = .004). The C index of the pT0N0 probability calculator was 0.77. On decision-curve analysis, the net benefit of the model was higher than the “treat-all” option within the clinically meaningful threshold probabilities of 40%-50%.The study presents a composite biomarker-based pT0N0 probability calculator that reveals the complex interplay between TMB and CPS, added to the clinical T stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bandini","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Jeffrey S"},{"family":"Raggi","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Gallina","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Colecchia","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Lucianò","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Giannatempo","given":"Patrizia"},{"family":"Farè","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Pederzoli","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Bianchi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Colombo","given":"Renzo"},{"family":"Gandaglia","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Fossati","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Marandino","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Capitanio","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Deho’","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Ali","given":"Siraj M"},{"family":"Madison","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Jon H"},{"family":"Salonia","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Briganti","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Montorsi","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Necchi","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"bandini_2021","container-title":"JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute","container-title-short":"JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute","DOI":"10.1093/jnci/djaa076","ISSN":"0027-8874","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,4]]},"page":"48-53","source":"Silverchair","title":"Predicting the Pathologic Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa076","volume":"113"},

Such experiments result in multivariate longitudinal data, which are unique in the sense that they allow the researcher to study the joint evolution of these outcomes over time. Special methods are required to analyse such data because repeated observations on any given response are likely to be correlated over time while multiple responses measured at a given time point will also be correlated. We review three approaches for analysing such data in the light of the associated theory, applications and software. The first method consists of the application of univariate longitudinal tools to a single summary outcome. The second method aims at estimating regression coefficients without explicitly modelling the underlying covariance structure of the data. The third method combines all the outcomes into a single joint multivariate model.

  {"id":"Banerjee2012","abstract":"Tree-based methods have become popular for analyzing complex data structures where the primary goal is risk stratification of patients. Ensemble techniques improve the accuracy in prediction and address the instability in a single tree by growing an ensemble of trees and aggregating. However, in the process, individual trees get lost. In this paper, we propose a methodology for identifying the most representative trees in an ensemble on the basis of several tree distance metrics. Although our focus is on binary outcomes, the methods are applicable to censored data as well. For any two trees, the distance metrics are chosen to (1) measure similarity of the covariates used to split the trees; (2) reflect similar clustering of patients in the terminal nodes of the trees; and (3) measure similarity in predictions from the two trees. Whereas the latter focuses on prediction, the first two metrics focus on the architectural similarity between two trees. The most representative trees in the ensemble are chosen on the basis of the average distance between a tree and all other trees in the ensemble. Out-of-bag estimate of error rate is obtained using neighborhoods of representative trees. Simulations and data examples show gains in predictive accuracy when averaging over such neighborhoods. We illustrate our methods using a dataset of kidney cancer treatment receipt (binary outcome) and a second dataset of breast cancer survival (censored outcome).

For example, neuroimaging datasets do not provide a sufficient representation of heart features for the modeling of cardiovascular factors in brain disorders. To tackle this problem we introduce a probabilistic framework for joint cardiac data imputation and personalisation of cardiovascular mechanistic models, with application to brain studies with incomplete heart data. Our approach is based on a variational framework for the joint inference of an imputation model of cardiac information from the available features, along with a Gaussian Process emulator that can faithfully reproduce personalised cardiovas-cular dynamics. Experimental results on UK Biobank show that our model allows accurate imputation of missing cardiac features in datasets containing minimal heart information, e.g. systolic and diastolic blood pressures only, while jointly estimating the emulated parameters of the lumped model. This allows a novel exploration of the heart-brain joint relationship through simulation of realistic cardiac dynamics corresponding to different conditions of brain anatomy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Banus","given":"Jaume"},{"family":"Sermesant","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Camara","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Lorenzi","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"banusJointDataImputation2020","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-59725-2_46","event-title":"MICCAI 2020 - 23th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,4]]},"language":"en","page":"478","source":"hal.inria.fr","title":"Joint data imputation and mechanistic modelling for simulating heart-brain interactions in incomplete datasets","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02952576"},

  {"id":"barkleyCausalInferenceObservational2017","abstract":"Inferring causal effects from an observational study is challenging because participants are not randomized to treatment. Observational studies in infectious disease research present the additional challenge that one participant's treatment may affect another participant's outcome, i.e., there may be interference. In this paper recent approaches to defining causal effects in the presence of interference are considered, and new causal estimands designed specifically for use with observational studies are proposed. Previously defined estimands target counterfactual scenarios in which individuals independently select treatment with equal probability. However, in settings where there is interference between individuals within clusters, it may be unlikely that treatment selection is independent between individuals in the same cluster. The proposed causal estimands instead describe counterfactual scenarios in which the treatment selection correlation structure is the same as in the observed data distribution, allowing for within-cluster dependence in the individual treatment selections. These estimands may be more relevant for policy-makers or public health officials who desire to quantify the effect of increasing the proportion of treated individuals in a population. Inverse probability-weighted estimators for these estimands are proposed. The large-sample properties of the estimators are derived, and a simulation study demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the estimators is presented. The proposed methods are illustrated by analyzing data from a study of cholera vaccination in over 100,000 individuals in Bangladesh.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Barkley","given":"Brian G."},{"family":"Hudgens","given":"Michael G."},{"family":"Clemens","given":"John D."},{"family":"Ali","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Emch","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"barkleyCausalInferenceObservational2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,13]]},"title":"Causal Inference from Observational Studies with Clustered Interference","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04834"},

  {"id":"basuMulticollinearityCorrectionCombined2020","abstract":"Model interpretability is one of the most intriguing problems in most of the Machine Learning models, particularly for those that are mathematically sophisticated. Computing Shapley Values are arguably the best approach so far to find the importance of each feature in a model, at the row level. In other words, Shapley values represent the importance of a feature for a particular row, especially for Classification or Regression problems. One of the biggest limitations of Shapley vales is that, Shapley value calculations assume all the features are uncorrelated (independent of each other), this assumption is often incorrect. To address this problem, we present a unified framework to calculate Shapley values with correlated features. To be more specific, we do an adjustment (Matrix formulation) of the features while calculating Independent Shapley values for the rows. Moreover, we have given a Mathematical proof against the said adjustments. With these adjustments, Shapley values (Importance) for the features become independent of the correlations existing between them. We have also enhanced this adjustment concept for more than features. As the Shapley values are additive, to calculate combined effect of two features, we just have to add their individual Shapley values. This is again not right if one or more of the features (used in the combination) are correlated with the other features (not in the combination). We have addressed this problem also by extending the correlation adjustment for one feature to multiple features in the said combination for which Shapley values are determined. Our implementation of this method proves that our method is computationally efficient also, compared to original Shapley method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Basu","given":"Indranil"},{"family":"Maji","given":"Subhadip"}],"citation-key":"basuMulticollinearityCorrectionCombined2020","DOI":"10.48550/ARXIV.2011.01661","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"license":"arXiv.org perpetual, non-exclusive license","publisher":"arXiv","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Multicollinearity Correction and Combined Feature Effect in Shapley Values","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01661","version":"1"},

BC is a complex disease with several molecular and pathological pathways, thus reﬂecting diﬀerent behaviors depending on the clinical staging of the tumor and molecular type. Diagnosis and monitoring of BC is mainly performed by invasive tests, namely periodic cystoscopies; this procedure, although a reliable method, is highly uncomfortable for the patient and it is not exempt of comorbidities. Currently, there is no formal indication for the use of molecular biomarkers in clinical practice, even though there are several tests available. There is an imperative need for a clinical non-invasive testing for early detection, disease monitoring, and treatment response in BC.

In this article Bayesian tree methods are developed for correlated survival data, relying on a computationally feasible, yet flexible, frailty model with piecewise constant hazard function. Bayesian stochastic search methods, using a Laplace approximated marginal likelihood, are detailed for tree construction, and posterior ensemble averaged variable importance ranking and amalgamation procedures are developed. The proposed methods are used to assign each tooth from the Veteran Administration (VA) Dental Longitudinal Study to one of five prognosis categories and evaluate the effects of clinical factors and genetic polymorphisms in predicting tooth loss. The prognostic rules established may be used in clinical practice to optimize tooth retention and devise periodontal treatment plans.","citation-key":"BayesianSurvivalTrees","language":"en","page":"1","source":"Zotero","title":"Bayesian survival trees for clustered observations, applied to tooth prognosis","type":"article-journal"},

We here combine Bayesian network learning with hierarchical variable clustering in order to detect groups of similar features and learn interactions between them entirely automated. We present an optimization algorithm for the adaptive refinement of such group Bayesian networks to account for a specific target variable, like a disease. The combination of Bayesian networks, clustering, and refinement yields low-dimensional but disease-specific interaction networks. These networks provide easily interpretable, yet accurate models of biomarker interdependencies. We test our method extensively on simulated data, as well as on data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-TREND), and demonstrate its effectiveness using non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypertension as examples. We show that the group network models outperform available biomarker scores, while at the same time, they provide an easily interpretable interaction network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Becker","given":"Ann-Kristin"},{"family":"Dörr","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Felix","given":"Stephan B."},{"family":"Frost","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Grabe","given":"Hans J."},{"family":"Lerch","given":"Markus M."},{"family":"Nauck","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Völker","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Völzke","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Kaderali","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"beckerHeterogeneousHealthcareData2021","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008735","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,12]]},"language":"en","page":"e1008735","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"From heterogeneous healthcare data to disease-specific biomarker networks: A hierarchical Bayesian network approach","title-short":"From heterogeneous healthcare data to disease-specific biomarker networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008735","volume":"17"},

Learning to predict time-to-event probabilities for these patients is a challenging problem because the risks of events are correlated (there are competing risks) with often only few patients experiencing individual events of interest, and of those only a fraction are actually observed in the data. We introduce in this paper a survival model with the ﬂexibility to leverage a common representation of related events that is designed to correct for the strong imbalance in observed outcomes. The procedure is sequential: outcome-speciﬁc survival distributions form the components of nonparametric multivariate estimators which we combine into an ensemble in such a way as to ensure accurate predictions on all outcome types simultaneously.

Therapies designed for patients at risk of multiple diseases need to account for the shared impact they may have on related diseases to ensure maximum overall well-being. Learning from data in this setting differs from classical survival analysis methods since the incidence of an event of interest may be obscured by other related competing events. We develop a semi-parametric Bayesian regression model for survival analysis with competing risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patient’s risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. We construct a Hierarchical Bayesian Mixture (HBM) model to describe survival paths in which a patient’s covariates influence both the estimation of the type of adverse event and the subsequent survival trajectory through Multivariate Random Forests. In addition variable importance measures, which are essential for clinical interpretability are induced naturally by our model.

  {"id":"belotFlexibleModelingCompeting2010","abstract":"Prognostic studies often involve modeling competing risks, where an individual can experience only one of alternative events, and the goal is to estimate hazard functions and covariate effects associated with each event type. Lunn and McNeil proposed data manipulation that permits extending the Cox's proportional hazards model to estimate covariate effects on the hazard of each competing events. However, the hazard functions for competing events are assumed to remain proportional over the entire follow-up period, implying the same shape of all event-specific hazards, and covariate effects are restricted to also remain constant over time, even if such assumptions are often questionable. To avoid such limitations, we propose a flexible model to (i) obtain distinct estimates of the baseline hazard functions for each event type, and (ii) allow estimating time-dependent covariate effects in a parsimonious model. Our flexible competing risks regression model uses smooth cubic regression splines to model the time-dependent changes in (i) the ratio of event-specific baseline hazards, and (ii) the covariate effects. In simulations, we evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators and likelihood ratio tests, under different assumptions. We apply the proposed flexible model in a prognostic study of colorectal cancer mortality, with two competing events: ‘death from colorectal cancer’ and ‘death from other causes’.

  {"id":"ben-david:","abstract":"Background and objective: Decision-making on the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment for patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) currently depends on assessment of clinical and pathological features, which lack sensitivity. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a possible novel prognostic biomarker in the ﬁeld. Our aim was to assess whether ctDNA status before RC is predictive of pathological and oncological outcomes. We also evaluated the dynamic changes in ctDNA status after RC in relation to recurrence-free survival (RFS).\nMethods: We analyzed data for patients who underwent RC during 2021–2023 for whom prospective tumor-informed ctDNA analyses were conducted before and after RC. RFS was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors for disease recurrence were assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Pathological outcomes associated with detectable ctDNA before RC were assessed in univariable and multivariable regression analyses. Key findings and limitations: We included 112 patients in the analysis. Median follow-up was 8 mo (interquartile range 4–13). ctDNA was detected before RC in 59 patients (53%) and was associated with poor RFS (log-rank p < 0.0001). Detectable ctDNA before RC was associated with poor outcomes regardless of clinical stage (<cT2 vs  cT2) and receipt of neoadjuvant therapy. Multivariable analyses revealed that detectable ctDNA before RC was associated with a higher risk of nodal disease (odds ratio 5.4, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.9–18.2; p = 0.003) and locally advanced disease (odds ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.5–9; p = 0.005). Cox regression analyses showed that detectable ctDNA before RC (hazard ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1–19; p = 0.04) and detectable ctDNA at the minimal residual disease window (hazard ratio 9.9, 95% CI 2.6–37; p < 0.001) were predictive of disease recurrence.\nConclusions and clinical implications: Detectable ctDNA before deﬁnitive therapy with RC is predictive of nodal involvement, locally advanced disease, and disease recurrence in patients with bladder cancer. ctDNA status holds promise for improving clinical staging and augmenting current decision-making tools.","author":[{"family":"Ben-David","given":"Reuben"},{"family":"Tillu","given":"Neeraja"},{"family":"Cumarasamy","given":"Shivaram"},{"family":"Alerasool","given":"Parissa"},{"family":"Rich","given":"Jordan M."},{"family":"Kaufmann","given":"Basil"},{"family":"Elkun","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Attalla","given":"Kyrollis"},{"family":"Mehrazin","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Wiklund","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Sfakianos","given":"John P."}],"citation-key":"ben-david:","container-title":"European Urology Oncology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euo.2024.03.002","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Longitudinal Tumor-informed Circulating Tumor DNA Status Predicts Disease Upstaging and Poor Prognosis for Patients Undergoing Radical Cystectomy","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"benderGeneralMachineLearning2021","abstract":"The modeling of time-to-event data, also known as survival analysis, requires specialized methods that can deal with censoring and truncation, time-varying features and effects, and that extend to settings with multiple competing events. However, many machine learning methods for survival analysis only consider the standard setting with right-censored data and proportional hazards assumption. The methods that do provide extensions usually address at most a subset of these challenges and often require specialized software that can not be integrated into standard machine learning workflows directly. In this work, we present a very general machine learning framework for time-to-event analysis that uses a data augmentation strategy to reduce complex survival tasks to standard Poisson regression tasks. This reformulation is based on well developed statistical theory. With the proposed approach, any algorithm that can optimize a Poisson (log-)likelihood, such as gradient boosted trees, deep neural networks, model-based boosting and many more can be used in the context of time-to-event analysis. The proposed technique does not require any assumptions with respect to the distribution of event times or the functional shapes of feature and interaction effects. Based on the proposed framework we develop new methods that are competitive with specialized state of the art approaches in terms of accuracy, and versatility, but with comparatively small investments of programming effort or requirements for specialized methodological know-how.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bender","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Rügamer","given":"David"},{"family":"Scheipl","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Bischl","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"benderGeneralMachineLearning2021","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-67664-3_10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"158-173","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A General Machine Learning Framework for Survival Analysis","type":"chapter","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15442","volume":"12459"},
  {"id":"benderGeneratingSurvivalTimes2005","abstract":"Simulation studies present an important statistical tool to investigate the performance, properties and adequacy of statistical models in pre-specified situations. One of the most important statistical models in medical research is the proportional hazards model of Cox. In this paper, techniques to generate survival times for simulation studies regarding Cox proportional hazards models are presented. A general formula describing the relation between the hazard and the corresponding survival time of the Cox model is derived, which is useful in simulation studies. It is shown how the exponential, the Weibull and the Gompertz distribution can be applied to generate appropriate survival times for simulation studies. Additionally, the general relation between hazard and survival time can be used to develop own distributions for special situations and to handle flexibly parameterized proportional hazards models. The use of distributions other than the exponential distribution is indispensable to investigate the characteristics of the Cox proportional hazards model, especially in non-standard situations, where the partial likelihood depends on the baseline hazard. A simulation study investigating the effect of measurement errors in the German Uranium Miners Cohort Study is considered to illustrate the proposed simulation techniques and to emphasize the importance of a careful modelling of the baseline hazard in Cox models.

Over the past few years, the debate has again received front-page attention, particularly through the public reminder by the American Statistical Association on how P values should be used and interpreted. At the core of the issue lies a fault in the way that scientific evidence is dichotomized and research is subsequently reported, and this fault is exacerbated by researchers giving license to statistical models to do scientific inference. This paper highlights a different approach to handling the evidence collected during a randomized controlled trial, one that does not dichotomize, but rather reports the evidence collected. Through the use of a coin flipping experiment and reanalysis of real-world data, the traditional approach of testing null hypothesis significance is contrasted with a Bayesian approach.

Although multivariable regression models adjust for confounders by modelling the relationship between covariates and outcome, the PS methods estimate the treatment effect by modelling the relationship between confounders and treatment assignment. Therefore, methods based on the PS are not limited by the number of events, and their use may be warranted when the number of confounders is large, or the number of outcomes is small. The PS is the probability for a subject to receive a treatment conditional on a set of baseline characteristics (confounders). The PS is commonly estimated using logistic regression, and it is used to match patients with similar distribution of confounders so that difference in outcomes gives unbiased estimate of treatment effect. This review summarizes basic concepts of the PS matching and provides guidance in implementing matching and other methods based on the PS, such as stratification, weighting and covariate adjustment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Benedetto","given":"Umberto"},{"family":"Head","given":"Stuart J"},{"family":"Angelini","given":"Gianni D"},{"family":"Blackstone","given":"Eugene H"}],"citation-key":"benedetto_2018","container-title":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","container-title-short":"European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","DOI":"10.1093/ejcts/ezy167","ISSN":"1010-7940","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"page":"1112-1117","source":"Silverchair","title":"Statistical primer: propensity score matching and its alternatives†","title-short":"Statistical primer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezy167","volume":"53"},

Nowadays, regulatory authorities appear to be more receptive to Bayesian methods than ever. The Bayesian methodology is well suited to address the issues arising in the planning, analysis, and conduct of clinical trials. Due to their flexibility, Bayesian design methods based on the accrued data of ongoing trials have been recommended by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for dose-response trials in early clinical development. A distinctive feature of the Bayesian approach is its ability to deal with external information, such as historical data, findings from previous studies and expert opinions, through prior elicitation. In fact, it provides a framework for embedding and handling the variability of auxiliary information within the planning and analysis of the study. A growing body of literature examines the use of historical data to augment newly collected data, especially in clinical trials where patients are difficult to recruit, which is the case for rare diseases, for example. Many works explore how this can be done properly, since using historical data has been recognized as less controversial than eliciting prior information from experts opinions.In this book, applications of Bayesian design in the planning and analysis of clinical trials are introduced, along with methodological contributions to specific topics of Bayesian statistics.

Searching for differences among subgroups is challenging because it is inherently a multiple testing problem with the complication that test statistics for subgroups are typically highly dependent, making simple multiplicity corrections such as the Bonferroni correction too conservative. In this article, a Bayesian approach to identify subgroup effects is proposed, with a scheme for assigning prior probabilities to possible subgroup effects that accounts for multiplicity and yet allows for (preexperimental) preference to specific subgroups. The analysis utilizes a new Bayesian model selection methodology and, as a by-product, produces individual probabilities of treatment effect that could be of use in personalized medicine. The analysis is illustrated on an example involving subgroup analysis of biomarker effects on treatments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Berger","given":"James O."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaojing"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"bergerBayesianApproachSubgroup2014","container-title":"Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics","DOI":"10.1080/10543406.2013.856026","ISSN":"1054-3406","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,2]]},"page":"110-129","PMID":"24392981","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A Bayesian Approach to Subgroup Identification","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10543406.2013.856026","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"berkStatisticalFrameworkBiomarker2011","abstract":"Motivation: Metabolomics is the study of the complement of small molecule metabolites in cells, biofluids and tissues. Many metabolomic experiments are designed to compare changes observed over time under two experimental conditions or groups (e.g. a control and drug-treated group) with the goal of identifying discriminatory metabolites or biomarkers that characterize each condition. A common study design consists of repeated measurements taken on each experimental unit thus producing time courses of all metabolites. We describe a statistical framework for estimating time-varying metabolic profiles and their within-group variability and for detecting between-group differences.

In this work, we present CellO, a machine learning-based tool for annotating human RNA-seq data with the Cell Ontology. CellO enables accurate and standardized cell type classification of cell clusters by considering the rich hierarchical structure of known cell types. Furthermore, CellO comes pre-trained on a comprehensive dataset of human, healthy, untreated primary samples in the Sequence Read Archive. CellO’s comprehensive training set enables it to run out-of-the-box on diverse cell types and achieves competitive or even superior performance when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, CellO’s linear models are easily interpreted, thereby enabling exploration of cell type-specific expression signatures across the ontology. To this end, we also present the CellO Viewer: a web application for exploring CellO’s models across the ontology.","author":[{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Matthew N."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Zhongjie"},{"family":"Gleicher","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dewey","given":"Colin N."}],"citation-key":"bernsteinCellOComprehensiveHierarchical2020","container-title":"iScience","DOI":"10.1016/j.isci.2020.101913","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3113049731","page":"101913","title":"CellO: comprehensive and hierarchical cell type classification of human cells with the Cell Ontology","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"berry_2006a","abstract":"The greatest virtue of traditional frequentist statistical approaches may be the extreme rigour and narrowness of focus, but a side effect of this virtue is inflexibility, which in turn limits innovation in the design and analysis of clinical trials.Because of this, clinical trials tend to be overly large, which increases the cost of developing new therapeutic approaches, and some patients are unnecessarily exposed to inferior experimental therapies. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address these issues.The defining characteristic of any statistical approach is how it deals with uncertainty. Unlike the frequentist approach, in the Bayesian approach, all uncertainty is measured by probability.The continuous learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse. Modifications include stopping the trial, adaptively assigning patients to therapies that are performing better or that will give more information about the scientific question of interest, and adding and dropping treatment arms.In analysing the results of a clinical trial, the Bayesian attitude is to bring all available information to bear on the scientific question being addressed. Outside of a Bayesian perspective, such potentially important information is usually overlooked because the methodology used cannot incorporate it.The Bayesian approach has several advantages in drug development, such as the process of updating knowledge gradually rather than restricting to large discrete steps measured in trials or phases. Another advantage is that it is specifically tied to decision making, within a particular trial, within a drug development programme, and within establishing a company's portfolio of drugs under development.Therapeutic areas in which the clinical endpoints are observed early stand to benefit most from an increase in the use of Bayesian approaches. Similiarly, diseases such as cancer in which there is a burgeoning number of biomarkers available for assessing the disease's progress will also benefit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Berry","given":"Donald A."}],"citation-key":"berry_2006a","container-title":"Nature Reviews Drug Discovery","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Drug Discov","DOI":"10.1038/nrd1927","ISSN":"1474-1784","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2006 Springer Nature Limited","page":"27-36","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Bayesian clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd1927","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"berry:2013","abstract":"Background\nIn oncology, the treatment paradigm is shifting toward personalized medicine, where the goal is to match patients to the treatments most likely to deliver benefit. Treatment effects in various subpopulations may provide some information about treatment effects in other subpopulations.\n\nPurpose\nWe compare different approaches to Phase II trial design where a new treatment is being investigated in several groups of patients. We compare considering each group in an independent trial to a single trial with hierarchical modeling of the patient groups.\n\nMethods\nWe assume four patient groups with different background response rates and simulate operating characteristics of three trial designs, Simon’s Optimal Two-Stage design, a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses, and a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses and hierarchical modeling across patient groups.\n\nResults\nSimon’s designs are based on 10% Type I and Type II error rates. The independent Bayesian designs are tuned to have similar error rates, but may have a slightly smaller mean sample size due to more frequent interim analyses. Under the null, the mean sample size is 2–4 patients smaller. A hierarchical model across patient groups can provide additional power and a further reduction in mean sample size. Under the null, the addition of the hierarchical model decreases the mean sample size an additional 4–7 patients in each group. Under the alternative hypothesis, power is increased to at least 98% in all groups.\n\nLimitations\nHierarchical borrowing can make finding a single group in which the treatment is promising, if there is only one, more difficult. In a scenario where the treatment is uninteresting in all but one group, power for that one group is reduced to 65%. When the drug appears promising in some groups and not in others, there is potential for borrowing to inflate the Type I error rate.\n\nConclusions\nThe Bayesian hierarchical design is more likely to correctly conclude efficacy or futility than the other two designs in many scenarios. The Bayesian hierarchical design is a strong design for addressing possibly differential effects in different groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Berry","given":"Scott M"},{"family":"Broglio","given":"Kristine R"},{"family":"Groshen","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Donald A"}],"citation-key":"berry:2013","container-title":"Clinical trials (London, England)","container-title-short":"Clin Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774513497539","ISSN":"1740-7745","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",10]]},"page":"720-734","PMCID":"PMC4319656","PMID":"23983156","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Bayesian hierarchical modeling of patient subpopulations: Efficient designs of Phase II oncology clinical trials","title-short":"Bayesian hierarchical modeling of patient subpopulations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4319656/","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"Bethi2013","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Functional limitations in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may be due to peripheral joint or axial involvement. To determine if the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), an axial-focused measure, can detect limitations related to peripheral joint involvement equally as well as the Health Assessment Questionnaire modified for the spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), a peripheral arthritis-focused measure, and vice versa, we compared associations of each questionnaire with spinal and hip range of motion, peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis in patients with AS. METHODS: We examined patients every 4-6 months in this prospective longitudinal study. We used mixed linear models to analyze the associations between 10 physical examination measures and the BASFI and HAQ-S. RESULTS: We studied 411 patients for a median of 1.5 years (median 3 visits). In multivariate analyses, cervical rotation, chest expansion, lateral thoracolumbar flexion, hip motion, tender joint count, and tender enthesis count were equally strongly associated with the BASFI and HAQ-S. Peripheral joint swelling was more strongly associated with the HAQ-S. Individual items of the BASFI were more likely than items of the HAQ-S to be associated with unrelated physical examination measures (e.g., the association between difficulty rising from a chair and cervical rotation), which may have diminished the axial/peripheral distinction for the BASFI. CONCLUSION: The BASFI and HAQ-S had similar associations with impairments in axial measures, while the HAQ-S had stronger associations with the number of swollen peripheral joints.

We have evaluated the stability [generalisability?] of batch correction results when integrated using diﬀerent subsets of batches, and quantiﬁed the downstream impact on cell classiﬁcation.\nResults: Using three publicly available datasets, we have demonstrated that batch correction may yield inconsistent results depending on the selection of batches to integrate, with up to 25% of cells potentially misclassiﬁed due to inconsistencies in the local structure. We have shown that certain cell types, notably T cells and cancerous cells, are more likely to be unstable than others. Consistency between integrations was evaluated using a number of metrics including the PRNN (proportion of retained nearest neighbours) and the PWCD (pairwise correlation distance).\nConclusions: Batch correction may yield diﬀerent results depending on the selection of batches to integrate, with potentially signiﬁcant impacts on the accuracy of cell type identiﬁcation and other downstream analyses.

  {"id":"beyersmannSimulatingCompetingRisks2009","abstract":"Competing risks analysis considers time-to-first-event (‘survival time’) and the event type (‘cause’), possibly subject to right-censoring. The cause-, i.e. event-specific hazards, completely determine the competing risk process, but simulation studies often fall back on the much criticized latent failure time model. Cause-specific hazard-driven simulation appears to be the exception; if done, usually only constant hazards are considered, which will be unrealistic in many medical situations. We explain simulating competing risks data based on possibly time-dependent cause-specific hazards. The simulation design is as easy as any other, relies on identifiable quantities only and adds to our understanding of the competing risks process. In addition, it immediately generalizes to more complex multistate models. We apply the proposed simulation design to computing the least false parameter of a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard model, which is a research question of independent interest in competing risks. The simulation specifications have been motivated by data on infectious complications in stem-cell transplanted patients, where results from cause-specific hazards analyses were difficult to interpret in terms of cumulative event probabilities. The simulation illustrates that results from a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard analysis can be interpreted as a time-averaged effect on the cumulative event probability scale.

Finding genetic biomarkers and searching genetic–epidemiological factors can be formulated as a statistical problem of variable selection, in which, from a large set of candidates, a small number of trait-associated predictors are identified. We illustrate our approach by analyzing the data available for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CFS is a complex disease from several aspects, e.g., it is difficult to diagnose and difficult to quantify. To identify biomarkers we used microarray data and SELDI-TOF-based proteomics data. We also analyzed genetic marker information for a large number of SNPs for an overlapping set of individuals. The objectives of the analyses were to identify markers specific to fatigue that are also possibly exclusive to CFS. The use of such models can be motivated, for example, by the search for new biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and measures of response to therapy.

The borrowing strength of the structural connectivity has been quantified for functional activity while detecting the biomarker. In the biomarker searching process, thousands of hypotheses are generated and tested simultaneously using our novel method to control the false discovery rate for small samples.

The identification and warning of infectious but asymptomatic individuals (i.e., contact tracing), the well-known patient-zero problem, or the inference of the infectivity values in structured populations are examples of significant epidemic inference problems. As the number of possible epidemic cascades grows exponentially with the number of individuals involved and only an almost negligible subset of them is compatible with the observations (e.g., medical tests), epidemic inference in contact networks poses incredible computational challenges. We present a new generative neural networks framework that learns to generate the most probable infection cascades compatible with observations. The proposed method achieves better (in some cases, significantly better) or comparable results with existing methods in all problems considered both in synthetic and real contact networks. Given its generality, clear Bayesian and variational nature, the presented framework paves the way to solve fundamental inference epidemic problems with high precision in small and medium-sized real case scenarios such as the spread of infections in workplaces and hospitals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Biazzo","given":"Indaco"},{"family":"Braunstein","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"Dall’Asta","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Mazza","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"biazzoBayesianGenerativeNeural2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-20898-x","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,16]]},"page":"19673","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A Bayesian generative neural network framework for epidemic inference problems | Scientific Reports","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-20898-x","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"bibbySystematicSingleCell2022","abstract":"Next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the study of T cell biology, capturing previously unrecognized diversity in cellular states and functions. Pathway analysis is a key analytical stage in the interpretation of such transcriptomic data, providing a powerful method for detecting alterations in important biological processes. Current pathway analysis tools are built on models developed for bulk-RNA sequencing, limiting their effectiveness when applied to more complex single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. We recently developed a sensitive and distribution-free statistical framework for multisample distribution testing, which we implement here in the open-source R package Single Cell Pathway Analysis (SCPA). After demonstrating the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, we generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation and between T cell populations. This revealed unexpected regulatory pathways in T cells, such as an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple human tissues also revealed alpha defensin expression as a hallmark of bone marrow derived T cells. Overall, our work here provides a widely applicable tool for single cell pathway analysis, and highlights unexpected regulatory mechanisms of T cells using a novel T cell dataset.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bibby","given":"Jack A"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Divyansh"},{"family":"Freiwald","given":"Tilo"},{"family":"Kunz","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Merle","given":"Nicolas S"},{"family":"West","given":"Erin E"},{"family":"Larochelle","given":"Andre"},{"family":"Chinian","given":"Fariba"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Somabha"},{"family":"Afzali","given":"Behdad"},{"family":"Kemper","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Nancy R"}],"citation-key":"bibbySystematicSingleCell2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.02.07.478807","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,10]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Immunology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Systematic Single Cell Pathway Analysis (SCPA) reveals novel pathways engaged during early T cell activation","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.02.07.478807"},

I think this is noble, but misguided. The point of view expressed here is that observables are fundamental, and that the goal of statistical modeling should be to predict future observations, given the current data and other relevant information. Further, the prediction of future observables provides multiple advantages to practicing scientists, and to science in general. These include an interpretable numerical summary of a quantity of direct interest to current and future researchers, a calibrated prediction of what’s likely to happen in future experiments, a prediction that can be either “corroborated” or “refuted” through experimentation, and avoidance of inference about parameters; quantities that exists only as convenient indices of hypothetical distributions. Finally, the predictive probability of a future observable can be used as a standard for communicating the reliability of the current work, regardless of whether confirmatory experiments are conducted. Adoption of this paradigm would improve our rigor for scientific accuracy and reproducibility by shifting our focus from “finding differences” among hypothetical parameters to predicting observable events based on our current scientific understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Billheimer","given":"Dean"}],"citation-key":"billheimerPredictiveInferenceScientific2019","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2018.1518270","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"number":"sup1","page":"291-295","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Predictive Inference and Scientific Reproducibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518270","volume":"73"},

The latter allows for tailored penalization of the covariates under consideration. Specifically, unpenalized mandatory covariates can be introduced. Microarray survival data from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in combination with the recent, bootstrap-based prediction error curve technique, is used to illustrate the advantages of the new procedure.\nConclusion: It is demonstrated that it can be highly beneficial in terms of prediction performance to use an estimation procedure that incorporates mandatory covariates into high-dimensional survival models.

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

Machine learning (ML) is suitable to improve early AD prediction. The etiology of AD is heterogeneous, which leads to high variability in disease patterns. Further variability originates from multicentric study designs, varying acquisition protocols, and errors in the preprocessing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The high variability makes the differentiation between signal and noise difficult and may lead to overfitting.

We specify a fully Bayesian hierarchical approach based on an ensemble ‘sum-of-trees’ model and illustrate our method using three popular survival models.

In addition, our method provides model-free variable selection of important prognostic markers based on controlling the false discovery rates; thus providing a unified procedure to select relevant genes and predict survivor functions.Results: We assess the performance of our method several simulated and real microarray datasets.

  {"id":"bonetti_2023","abstract":"Machine learning algorithms are designed to capture complex relationships between features. In this context, the high dimensionality of data often results in poor model performance, with the risk of overfitting. Feature selection, the process of selecting a subset of relevant and non-redundant features, is, therefore, an essential step to mitigate these issues. However, classical feature selection approaches do not inspect the causal relationship between selected features and target, which can lead to misleading results in real-world applications. Causal discovery, instead, aims to identify causal relationships between features with observational data. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology at the intersection between feature selection and causal discovery, focusing on time series. We introduce a new causal feature selection approach that relies on the forward and backward feature selection procedures and leverages transfer entropy to estimate the causal flow of information from the features to the target in time series. Our approach enables the selection of features not only in terms of mere model performance but also captures the causal information flow. In this context, we provide theoretical guarantees on the regression and classification errors for both the exact and the finite-sample cases. Finally, we present numerical validations on synthetic and real-world regression problems, showing results competitive w.r.t. the considered baselines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonetti","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Metelli","given":"Alberto Maria"},{"family":"Restelli","given":"Marcello"}],"citation-key":"bonetti_2023","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"language":"en","title":"Causal Feature Selection via Transfer Entropy","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11059v1"},

  {"id":"boonstra:2014","abstract":"For binary or categorical response models, most goodness-of-fit statistics are based on the notion of partitioning the subjects into groups or regions and comparing the observed and predicted responses in these regions by a suitable chi-squared distribution. Existing strategies create this partition based on the predicted response probabilities, or propensity scores, from the fitted model. In this paper, we follow a retrospective approach, borrowing the notion of balancing scores used in causal inference to inspect the conditional distribution of the predictors, given the propensity scores, in each category of the response to assess model adequacy. We can use this diagnostic under both prospective and retrospective sampling designs, and it may ascertain general forms of misspecification. We first present simple graphical and numerical summaries that can be used in a binary logistic model. We then generalize the tools to propose model diagnostics for the proportional odds model. We illustrate the methods with simulation studies and two data examples: (i) a case-control study of the association between cumulative lead exposure and Parkinson's disease in the Boston, Massachusetts, area and (ii) and a cohort study of biomarkers possibly associated with diabetes, from the VA Normative Aging Study.

  {"id":"boonstraIncorporatingAuxiliaryInformation","abstract":"With advancement in genomic technologies, it is common that two high-dimensional datasets are available, both measuring the same underlying biological phenomenon with different techniques. We consider predicting a continuous outcome Y using X, a set of p markers which is the best available measure of the underlying biological process. This same biological process may also be measured by W , coming from a prior technology but correlated with X. On a moderately sized sample, we have (Y, X, W ), and on a larger sample we have (Y, W ). We utilize the data on W to boost the prediction of Y by X. When p is large and the subsample containing X is small, this is a p > n situation. When p is small, this is akin to the classical measurement error problem; however, ours is not the typical goal of calibrating W for use in future studies. We propose to shrink the regression coefficients β of Y on X toward different targets that use information derived from W in the larger dataset. We compare these proposals with the classical ridge regression of Y on X, which does not use W . We also unify all of these methods as targeted ridge estimators. Finally, we propose a hybrid estimator which is a linear combination of multiple estimators of β. With an optimal choice of weights, the hybrid estimator balances efficiency and robustness in a data-adaptive way to theoretically yield a smaller prediction error than any of its constituents. The methods, including a fully Bayesian alternative, are evaluated via simulation studies. We also apply them to a gene-expression dataset. mRNA expression measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is used to predict survival time in lung cancer patients, with auxiliary information from microarray technology available on a larger sample.","author":[{"family":"Boonstra","given":"Philip S"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Jeremy M G"},{"family":"Mukherjee","given":"Bhramar"}],"citation-key":"boonstraIncorporatingAuxiliaryInformation","language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Incorporating auxiliary information for improved prediction in high-dimensional datasets: an ensemble of shrinkage approaches","type":"article-journal"},

Most commonly, it is used to understand the etiology of a public health issue, to assess the impact of an intervention, or to provide detection of unusual behavior. In this article, we present a Bayesian mixture model for public health surveillance, which is able to provide estimates of the disease risk in space and time, and also to detect areas with unusual behavior. The model is designed to deal with a range of spatial and temporal patterns in the data, and with time series of different lengths. We carry out a simulation study to assess the performance of the model under different scenarios, and we compare it against a recently proposed Bayesian model for short time series. Finally, the proposed model is used for surveillance of road traffic accidents data in England over the years 2005–2015.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Boulieri","given":"Areti"},{"family":"Bennett","given":"James E"},{"family":"Blangiardo","given":"Marta"}],"citation-key":"boulieri_2020","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy038","ISSN":"1468-4357","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"369-383","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"A Bayesian mixture modeling approach for public health surveillance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/21/3/369/5106689","volume":"21"},

For normally distributed outcomes, an assumption for the variance needs to be made which is usually based on limited prior information. Especially in the case of small populations, the prior information might consist of only one small pilot study. A Bayesian approach formalizes the aggregation of prior information on the variance with newly collected data. The uncertainty surrounding prior estimates can be appropriately modelled by means of prior distributions. Furthermore, within the Bayesian paradigm, quantities such as the probability of a conclusive trial are directly calculated. However, if the postulated prior is not in accordance with the true variance, such calculations are not trustworthy. In this work we adapt previously suggested methodology to facilitate sample size re-estimation.

  {"id":"brardBayesianSurvivalAnalysis2017","abstract":"Background\nBayesian statistics are an appealing alternative to the traditional frequentist approach to designing, analysing, and reporting of clinical trials, especially in rare diseases. Time-to-event endpoints are widely used in many medical fields. There are additional complexities to designing Bayesian survival trials which arise from the need to specify a model for the survival distribution. The objective of this article was to critically review the use and reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials.\nMethods\nA systematic review of clinical trials using Bayesian survival analyses was performed through PubMed and Web of Science databases. This was complemented by a full text search of the online repositories of pre-selected journals. Cost-effectiveness, dose-finding studies, meta-analyses, and methodological papers using clinical trials were excluded.\nResults\nIn total, 28 articles met the inclusion criteria, 25 were original reports of clinical trials and 3 were re-analyses of a clinical trial. Most trials were in oncology (n = 25), were randomised controlled (n = 21) phase III trials (n = 13), and half considered a rare disease (n = 13). Bayesian approaches were used for monitoring in 14 trials and for the final analysis only in 14 trials. In the latter case, Bayesian survival analyses were used for the primary analysis in four cases, for the secondary analysis in seven cases, and for the trial re-analysis in three cases. Overall, 12 articles reported fitting Bayesian regression models (semi-parametric, n = 3; parametric, n = 9). Prior distributions were often incompletely reported: 20 articles did not define the prior distribution used for the parameter of interest. Over half of the trials used only non-informative priors for monitoring and the final analysis (n = 12) when it was specified. Indeed, no articles fitting Bayesian regression models placed informative priors on the parameter of interest. The prior for the treatment effect was based on historical data in only four trials. Decision rules were pre-defined in eight cases when trials used Bayesian monitoring, and in only one case when trials adopted a Bayesian approach to the final analysis.\nConclusion\nFew trials implemented a Bayesian survival analysis and few incorporated external data into priors. There is scope to improve the quality of reporting of Bayesian methods in survival trials. Extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for reporting Bayesian clinical trials is recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Brard","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Le Teuff","given":"Gwénaël"},{"family":"Le Deley","given":"Marie-Cécile"},{"family":"Hampson","given":"Lisa V"}],"citation-key":"brardBayesianSurvivalAnalysis2017","container-title":"Clinical Trials","container-title-short":"Clinical Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774516673362","ISSN":"1740-7745","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"78-87","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Bayesian survival analysis in clinical trials: What methods are used in practice?","title-short":"Bayesian survival analysis in clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774516673362","volume":"14"},

And, as stated by Dennis Lindley in a more general context, “[t]he simple practical question of ‘What size of sample should I take’ is often posed to a statistician, and it is a question that is embarrassingly difficult to answer.” Historically, simulation has been the primary option for determining sample sizes for adaptive Phase I trials, and although useful, can be problematic and time-consuming when a sample size is needed relatively quickly. We propose a computationally fast and simple approach that uses Beta distributions to approximate the posterior distributions of DLT rates of each dose and determines an appropriate sample size through posterior coverage rates. We provide sample sizes produced by our methods for a vast number of realistic Phase I trial settings and demonstrate that our sample sizes are generally larger than those produced by a competing approach that is based upon the nonparametric optimal design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Braun","given":"Thomas M."}],"citation-key":"braun_2018","container-title":"Biometrics","container-title-short":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/biom.12872","ISSN":"0006-341X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,1]]},"page":"1065-1071","source":"Silverchair","title":"Motivating Sample Sizes in Adaptive Phase I Trials Via Bayesian Posterior Credible Intervals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12872","volume":"74"},

Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as new cell types. MARS overcomes the heterogeneity of cell types by transferring latent cell representations across multiple datasets. MARS uses deep learning to learn a cell embedding function as well as a set of landmarks in the cell embedding space. The method has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are as yet unannotated. We apply MARS to a large mouse cell atlas and show its ability to accurately identify cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, MARS automatically generates interpretable names for new cell types by probabilistically defining a cell type in the embedding space.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Brbić","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Zitnik","given":"Marinka"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Pisco","given":"Angela O."},{"family":"Altman","given":"Russ B."},{"family":"Darmanis","given":"Spyros"},{"family":"Leskovec","given":"Jure"}],"citation-key":"brbicMARSDiscoveringNovel2020","container-title":"Nature Methods","container-title-short":"Nat Methods","DOI":"10.1038/s41592-020-00979-3","ISSN":"1548-7105","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"12","page":"1200-1206","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"MARS: discovering novel cell types across heterogeneous single-cell experiments","title-short":"MARS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00979-3","volume":"17"},

Starting from the basic requirements that inferred expression states should correct for both biological and measurement sampling noise and that changes in expression should be measured in terms of fold changes, we here derive a Bayesian normalization procedure called Sanity (SAmpling-Noise-corrected Inference of Transcription activitY) from first principles. Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Breda","given":"Jérémie"},{"family":"Zavolan","given":"Mihaela"},{"family":"Nimwegen","given":"Erik","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"breda_2021","container-title":"Nature Biotechnology","container-title-short":"Nat Biotechnol","DOI":"10.1038/s41587-021-00875-x","ISSN":"1546-1696","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","page":"1008-1016","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Bayesian inference of gene expression states from single-cell RNA-seq data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00875-x","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"brilleman_2020","abstract":"Survival data is encountered in a range of disciplines, most notably health and medical research. Although Bayesian approaches to the analysis of survival data can provide a number of beneﬁts, they are less widely used than classical (e.g. likelihood-based) approaches. This may be in part due to a relative absence of user-friendly implementations of Bayesian survival models. In this article we describe how the rstanarm R package can be used to ﬁt a wide range of Bayesian survival models. The rstanarm package facilitates Bayesian regression modelling by providing a user-friendly interface (users specify their model using customary R formula syntax and data frames) and using the Stan software (a C++ library for Bayesian inference) for the back-end estimation. The suite of models that can be estimated using rstanarm is broad and includes generalised linear models (GLMs), generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), generalised additive models (GAMs) and more. In this article we focus only on the survival modelling functionality. This includes standard parametric (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz) and ﬂexible parametric (spline-based) hazard models, as well as standard parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models. All types of censoring (left, right, interval) are allowed, as is delayed entry (left truncation), time-varying covariates, time-varying eﬀects, and frailty eﬀects.

  {"id":"brillemanJointLongitudinalHurdle2016","abstract":"Shared parameter joint models provide a framework under which a longitudinal response and a time to event can be modelled simultaneously. A common assumption in shared parameter joint models has been to assume that the longitudinal response is normally distributed. In this paper, we instead propose a joint model that incorporates a two-part ‘hurdle’ model for the longitudinal response, motivated in part by longitudinal response data that is subject to a detection limit. The first part of the hurdle model estimates the probability that the longitudinal response is observed above the detection limit, whilst the second part of the hurdle model estimates the mean of the response conditional on having exceeded the detection limit. The time-to-event outcome is modelled using a parametric proportional hazards model, assuming a Weibull baseline hazard. We propose a novel association structure whereby the current hazard of the event is assumed to be associated with the current combined (expected) outcome from the two parts of the hurdle model. We estimate our joint model under a Bayesian framework and provide code for fitting the model using the Bayesian software Stan. We use our model to estimate the association between HIV RNA viral load, which is subject to a lower detection limit, and the hazard of stopping or modifying treatment in patients with HIV initiating antiretroviral therapy.

Increasingly, extensions to standard joint modelling approaches are being proposed to handle complex data structures commonly encountered in applied research. In this paper we propose a joint model for hierarchical longitudinal and time-to-event data. Our motivating application explores the association between tumor burden and progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. We define tumor burden as a function of the sizes of target lesions clustered within a patient. Since a patient may have more than one lesion, and each lesion is tracked over time, the data have a three-level hierarchical structure: repeated measurements taken at time points (level 1) clustered within lesions (level 2) within patients (level 3). We jointly model the lesion-specific longitudinal trajectories and patient-specific risk of death or disease progression by specifying novel association structures that combine information across lower level clusters (e.g. lesions) into patient-level summaries (e.g. tumor burden). We provide user-friendly software for fitting the model under a Bayesian framework. Lastly, we discuss alternative situations in which additional clustering factor(s) occur at a level higher in the hierarchy than the patient-level, since this has implications for the model formulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Brilleman","given":"Samuel L."},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Moreno-Betancur","given":"Margarita"},{"family":"Novik","given":"Jacqueline Buros"},{"family":"Dunyak","given":"James"},{"family":"Al-Huniti","given":"Nidal"},{"family":"Fox","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Hammerbacher","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Rory"}],"citation-key":"brillemanJointLongitudinalTimetoevent2018","container-title":"arXiv:1805.06099 [stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,15]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Joint longitudinal and time-to-event models for multilevel hierarchical data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06099"},

The ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve gives the intrinsic accuracy of medical tests that have ordinal or continuous scores, and the Bayesian approach is illustrated with many examples from cancer and other diseases. Medical tests include X-ray, mammography, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine and tests based on biomarkers, such as blood glucose values for diabetes.

We follow a Bayesian approach and we say an experiment is\n              successful\n              if it yields a large posterior probability that an unknown parameter of interest (an unknown treatment effect or an effects‐difference) is greater than a chosen threshold. In this context, a straightforward sample size criterion is to select the minimal number of observations so that the predictive probability of a successful trial is sufficiently large. In the paper we address the most typical criticism to Bayesian methods—their sensitivity to prior assumptions—by proposing a robust version of this sample size criterion. Specifically, instead of a single distribution, we consider a\n              class\n              of plausible priors for the parameter of interest. Robust sample sizes are then selected by looking at the predictive distribution of the lower bound of the posterior probability that the unknown parameter is greater than a chosen threshold. For their flexibility and mathematical tractability, we consider classes of ε‐contamination priors. As specific applications we consider sample size determination for a Phase III trial.

Previous studies led to the surprising observation that alternative splicing among single cells is highly variable and follows a bimodal pattern: a given cell consistently produces either one or the other isoform for a particular splicing choice, with few cells producing both isoforms. Here, we show that this pattern arises almost entirely from technical limitations. We analyze alternative splicing in human and mouse single-cell RNA-seq datasets, and model them with a probabilistic simulator. Our simulations show that low gene expression and low capture efficiency distort the observed distribution of isoforms. This gives the appearance of binary splicing outcomes, even when the underlying reality is consistent with more than one isoform per cell. We show that accounting for the true amount of information recovered can produce biologically meaningful measurements of splicing in single cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Buen Abad Najar","given":"Carlos F"},{"family":"Yosef","given":"Nir"},{"family":"Lareau","given":"Liana F"}],"citation-key":"buenabadnajarCoveragedependentBiasCreates2020","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.54603","editor":[{"family":"Churchman","given":"L Stirling"},{"family":"Wittkopp","given":"Patricia J"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,29]]},"page":"e54603","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Coverage-dependent bias creates the appearance of binary splicing in single cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54603","volume":"9"},

While the statistical handling of randomized experimental studies is well documented in the medical literature, the analysis of observational studies requires the addressing of additional important issues relating to the timing of entry to the study and the effect of potential explanatory variables not introduced until after that time. A series of analyses is illustrated on a small data set. The influence of single and multiple explanatory variables on the outcome after a fixed time interval and on survival time until a specific event are examined. The analysis of the effect on survival of factors that only come into play during follow-up is then considered. The aim of each analysis, the choice of data used, the essentials of the methodology, the interpretation of the results and the limitations and underlying assumptions are discussed. It is emphasized that, in contrast to randomized studies, the basis for selection and timing of interventions in observational studies is not precisely specified so that attribution of a survival effect to an intervention must be tentative.

This modiﬁcation facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in β-VAE, without the previous trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Christopher P"},{"family":"Higgins","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Pal","given":"Arka"},{"family":"Matthey","given":"Loic"},{"family":"Watters","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Desjardins","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Lerchner","given":"Alexander"}],"citation-key":"burgessUnderstandingDisentanglingVVAE","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Understanding disentangling in β-VAE","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"butaBayesianJointModelling2018","abstract":"In alcoholism research, several complementary outcomes are of interest: abstinence from drinking during a specific time frame, and, when the individual is drinking, frequency of drinking (the proportion of days on which drinking occurs) and intensity of drinking (the average number of drinks per drinking day). The outcomes are often measured repeatedly over time on the same subject and, although they are closely related, they are rarely modelled together. We propose a joint model that allows us to fit these longitudinal outcomes simultaneously, using correlated random effects to model the association between the outcomes and between repeated measurements on the same subject. The model has three parts: a logistic part for sustained abstinence over the period of interest, a truncated binomial part for frequency of drinking and a log-normal model for drinking intensity when drinking occurs. Because of the computational impracticality of fitting models with many random effects by using standard frequentist approaches, we use a Bayesian approach to fit the joint model. We also conduct a simulation study to investigate the gains in parameter estimate bias and mean-squared error associated with joint versus separate modelling. We illustrate the approach on data from an alcoholism clinical trial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Buta","given":"Eugenia"},{"family":"O’Malley","given":"Stephanie S."},{"family":"Gueorguieva","given":"Ralitza"}],"citation-key":"butaBayesianJointModelling2018","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society)","DOI":"10.1111/rssa.12334","ISSN":"1467-985X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 Royal Statistical Society","number":"3","page":"869-888","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Bayesian joint modelling of longitudinal data on abstinence, frequency and intensity of drinking in alcoholism trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rssa.12334","volume":"181"},

In this article, we describe the history of the role of microsimulation in medicine and its potential applications in oncology as useful tools for population risk stratification and treatment strategy design for precision medicine.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted a comprehensive and methodical search of the literature using electronic databases—Medline, Embase, and Cochrane—for works published between 1985 and 2016. A medical subject heading search strategy was constructed for Medline searches by using a combination of relevant search terms, such as “microsimulation model medicine,” “multistate modeling cancer,” and “oncology.”\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Microsimulation modeling is particularly useful for the study of optimal intervention strategies when randomized control trials may not be feasible, ethical, or practical.

The model, which incorporated established prognostic factors, was externally validated using independent data. Its performance was compared with that of the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and Adjuvant! Online.\nRESULTS: The number of positive axillary lymph nodes, tumour grade, tumour size and patient age were strong predictors of recurrence. Oestrogen receptor (ER) positivity was shown to afford a moderate protective effect. The model was able to separate patients into distinct prognostic groups, and predicted well at the patient level, mean Brier Accuracy Score=0.17 (s.e.=0.004) and overall C=0.745 (95% CI, 0.717-0.773). Its performance diminished only slightly when applied to a second independent data set. When compared with the NPI, the model was able to better discriminate between women with excellent and good prognoses, and it did not overestimate 10-year recurrence-free survival to the extent observed for Adjuvant! Online.\nCONCLUSION: The model estimated here predicts well at both the individual patient and group levels, and appears transportable to patients treated at other UK hospitals. Its parametric form permits long-term extrapolation giving it an advantage over other prognostic tools currently in use. A simple point scoring system and reference table allow 5-, 10-, and 15-year predictions from the model to be quickly and easily estimated. The model is also available to download as an interactive computer program.","author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"H. E."},{"family":"Gray","given":"A. M."},{"family":"Harris","given":"A.

  {"id":"cannas:2019","abstract":"Propensity score matching (PSM) and propensity score weighting (PSW) are popular tools to estimate causal effects in observational studies. We address two open issues: how to estimate propensity scores and assess covariate balance. Using simulations, we compare the performance of PSM and PSW based on logistic regression and machine learning algorithms (CART; Bagging; Boosting; Random Forest; Neural Networks; naive Bayes). Additionally, we consider several measures of covariate balance (Absolute Standardized Average Mean (ASAM) with and without interactions; measures based on the quantile-quantile plots; ratio between variances of propensity scores; area under the curve (AUC)) and assess their ability in predicting the bias of PSM and PSW estimators. We also investigate the importance of tuning of machine learning parameters in the context of propensity score methods. Two simulation designs are employed. In the first, the generating processes are inspired to birth register data used to assess the effect of labor induction on the occurrence of caesarean section. The second exploits more general generating mechanisms. Overall, among the different techniques, random forests performed the best, especially in PSW. Logistic regression and neural networks also showed an excellent performance similar to that of random forests. As for covariate balance, the simplest and commonly used metric, the ASAM, showed a strong correlation with the bias of causal effects estimators. Our findings suggest that researchers should aim at obtaining an ASAM lower than 10% for as many variables as possible. In the empirical study we found that labor induction had a small and not statistically significant impact on caesarean section.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Cannas","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Arpino","given":"Bruno"}],"citation-key":"cannas:2019","container-title":"Biometrical Journal","DOI":"10.1002/bimj.201800132","ISSN":"1521-4036","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  {"id":"caoSystematicEvaluationSupervised2022","abstract":"The new technology of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can yield valuable insights into gene expression and give critical information about the cellular compositions of complex tissues. In recent years, vast numbers of scRNA-seq datasets have been generated and made publicly available, and this has enabled researchers to train supervised machine learning models for predicting or classifying various cell-level phenotypes. This has led to the development of many new methods for analyzing scRNA-seq data. Despite the popularity of such applications, there has as yet been no systematic investigation of the performance of these supervised algorithms using predictors from various sizes of scRNA-seq datasets. In this study, 13 popular supervised machine learning algorithms for cell phenotype classification were evaluated using published real and simulated datasets with diverse cell sizes. This benchmark comprises two parts. In the first, real datasets were used to assess the computing speed and cell phenotype classification performance of popular supervised algorithms. The classification performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, F1-score, Precision, Recall, and false-positive rate. In the second part, we evaluated gene-selection performance using published simulated datasets with a known list of real genes. The results showed that ElasticNet with interactions performed the best for small and medium-sized datasets. The NaiveBayes classifier was found to be another appropriate method for medium-sized datasets. With large datasets, the performance of the XGBoost algorithm was found to be excellent. Ensemble algorithms were not found to be significantly superior to individual machine learning methods. Including interactions in the ElasticNet algorithm caused a significant performance improvement for small datasets. The linear discriminant analysis algorithm was found to be the best choice when speed is critical; it is the fastest method, it can scale to handle large sample sizes, and its performance is not much worse than the top performers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Li"},{"family":"Majd","given":"Elham"},{"family":"He","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Junhua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuekui"}],"citation-key":"caoSystematicEvaluationSupervised2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Genetics","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"carusoDeepLearningApproach2023","abstract":"One of the most challenging fields where Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied is lung cancer research, specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In particular, overall survival (OS), the time between diagnosis and death, is a vital indicator of patient status, enabling tailored treatment and improved OS rates. In this analysis, there are two challenges to take into account. First, few studies effectively exploit the information available from each patient, leveraging both uncensored (i.e., dead) and censored (i.e., survivors) patients, considering also the events' time. Second, the handling of incomplete data is a common issue in the medical field. This problem is typically tackled through the use of imputation methods. Our objective is to present an AI model able to overcome these limits, effectively learning from both censored and uncensored patients and their available features, for the prediction of OS for NSCLC patients. We present a novel approach to survival analysis with missing values in the context of NSCLC, which exploits the strengths of the transformer architecture to account only for available features without requiring any imputation strategy.

The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.","author":[{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Carlos M."},{"family":"Polson","given":"Nicholas G."},{"family":"Scott","given":"James G."}],"citation-key":"carvalhoHandlingSparsityHorseshoe2009","collection-title":"Proceedings of machine learning research","container-title":"Proceedings of the twelth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics","editor":[{"family":"Dyk","given":"David","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Welling","given":"Max"}],"event-place":"Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort, Clearwater Beach, Florida USA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,16],["2009",4,18]]},"page":"73–80","publisher":"PMLR","publisher-place":"Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort, Clearwater Beach, Florida USA","title":"Handling sparsity via the horseshoe","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v5/carvalho09a.html","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"casaletto_2023","abstract":"Continued advances in precision medicine rely on the widespread sharing of data that relate human genetic variation to disease. However, data sharing is severely limited by legal, regulatory, and ethical restrictions that safeguard patient privacy. Federated analysis addresses this problem by transferring the code to the data—providing the technical and legal capability to analyze the data within their secure home environment rather than transferring the data to another institution for analysis. This allows researchers to gain new insights from data that cannot be moved, while respecting patient privacy and the data stewards’ legal obligations. Because federated analysis is a technical solution to the legal challenges inherent in data sharing, the technology and policy implications must be evaluated together. Here, we summarize the technical approaches to federated analysis and provide a legal analysis of their policy implications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Casaletto","given":"James"},{"family":"Bernier","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"McDougall","given":"Robyn"},{"family":"Cline","given":"Melissa S."}],"citation-key":"casaletto_2023","container-title":"Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-genom-110122-084756","ISSN":"1527-8204, 1545-293X","issue":"Volume 24, 2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,25]]},"language":"en","page":"347-368","publisher":"Annual Reviews","source":"www.annualreviews.org","title":"Federated Analysis for Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing: A Technical and Legal Primer","title-short":"Federated Analysis for Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-genom-110122-084756","volume":"24"},

Further, we show optimal posterior contraction rates for the hazard in terms of the supremum norm. In medical studies, a popular approach is to model hazards a priori as random histograms with possibly dependent heights.

We extend projection predictive inference to enable computationally efficient variable and structure selection in models outside the exponential family. By adopting a latent space projection predictive perspective we are able to: 1) propose a unified and general framework to do variable selection in complex models while fully honouring the original model structure, 2) properly identify relevant structure and retain posterior uncertainties from the original model, and 3) provide an improved approach also for non-Gaussian models in the exponential family. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach by thoroughly testing and comparing it against popular variable selection approaches in a wide range of settings, including realistic data sets.

A previously developed economic model was updated with the new meta-analysis results and current cost data. The model was adapted to delineate patients by PASI 50%, 75% and 90% response rates to differentiate between psoriasis outcomes.\n\nRESULTS:All four licensed TNF-α inhibitors were significantly more effective than placebo in achieving PsARC response in patients with active PsA. Adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab were significantly more effective than placebo in improving HAQ scores in patients who had achieved a PsARC response and in improving HAQ scores in PsARC non-responders. In an analysis using 1,000 model simulations, on average etanercept was the most cost-effective treatment and, at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence willingness-to-pay threshold of between £20,000 to £30,000, etanercept is the preferred option.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:The economic analysis agrees with the conclusions from the previous models, in that biologics are shown to be cost-effective for treating patients with active PsA compared with the conventional management strategy. In particular, etanercept is cost-effective compared with the other biologic treatments.","author":[{"family":"Cawson","given":"Matthew Richard"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Stephen Andrew"},{"family":"Knight","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Wildey","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Spurden","given":"Dean"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Orme","given":"Michelle Elaine"}],"citation-key":"Cawson2014","container-title":"BMC musculoskeletal disorders","event-place":"Abacus International, 6 Talisman Business Centre, Talisman Road, Bicester OX26 6HR, UK. stephen.mitchell@abacusint.com.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"26","publisher-place":"Abacus International, 6 Talisman Business Centre, Talisman Road, Bicester OX26 6HR, UK. stephen.mitchell@abacusint.com.","title":"Systematic review, network meta-analysis and economic evaluation of biological therapy for the management of active psoriatic arthritis.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=24444034&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"15"},

In classification, these assumptions are minimal as the commonly employed softmax is capable of representing any categorical distribution. In regression, however, restrictive assumptions on the type of continuous distribution to be realized are typically placed, like the dominant choice of training via mean-squared error and its underlying Gaussianity assumption. Recently, modelling advances allow to be agnostic to the type of continuous distribution to be modelled, granting regression the flexibility of classification models. While past studies stress the benefit of such flexible regression models in terms of performance, here we study the effect of the model choice on uncertainty estimation. We highlight that under model misspecification, aleatoric uncertainty is not properly captured, and that a Bayesian treatment of a misspecified model leads to unreliable epistemic uncertainty estimates. Overall, our study provides an overview on how modelling choices in regression may influence uncertainty estimation and thus any downstream decision making process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cervera","given":"Maria R."},{"family":"Dätwyler","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"D'Angelo","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Keurti","given":"Hamza"},{"family":"Grewe","given":"Benjamin F."},{"family":"Henning","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"cerveraUncertaintyEstimationModel2021","container-title":"arXiv:2111.11763 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,23]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Uncertainty estimation under model misspecification in neural network regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11763"},
  {"id":"cetinFairPerformanceComparison2021","abstract":"Random Forest (RF), a mostly model-free and robust machine learning method, has been successfully applied to right-censored survival data, under the name of Random Survival Forest (RSF). However, RF/RSF has its distinct strategies in classification and prediction. First, it is an ensemble classifier and its performance is an average of multiple rounds of data fitting. Second, the training set is a bootstrap (sampling with replacement) generated set with repeated used of roughly 2/3 of all samples and testing set consists of those not used (out of bag samples). Both features are not intrinsic to Cox regression or other single classifiers. Not considering these two features could potentially lead to a partial comparison between the performance of the two methods. By using a colorectal survival dataset, we illustrate the problems of using k-fold cross-validation, using only one resampling without an ensemble average, and using the whole dataset for both fitting and testing, in Cox regression, when comparing with RSF. We provide a more accessible R code for simple calculation of discordance index (D-index) and unweighted integrated Brier score (IBS) for Cox regression, and unweighted IBS for RSF. Doi: 10.28991/SciMedJ-2021-0301-9 Full Text: PDF","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Cetin","given":"Sirin"},{"family":"Ulgen","given":"Ayse"},{"family":"Dede","given":"Isa"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wentian"}],"citation-key":"cetinFairPerformanceComparison2021","container-title":"SciMedicine Journal","DOI":"10.28991/SciMedJ-2021-0301-9","ISSN":"2704-9833","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"- The authors retain all copyrights.

Our approach combines a proper latent space modeling of the VAE seen as a Riemannian manifold with a new generation scheme which produces more meaningful samples especially in the context of small data sets. The proposed method is tested through a wide experimental study where its robustness to data sets, classifiers and training samples size is stressed. It is also validated on a medical imaging classification task on the challenging ADNI database where a small number of 3D brain MRIs are considered and augmented using the proposed VAE framework. In each case, the proposed method allows for a significant and reliable gain in the classification metrics. For instance, balanced accuracy jumps from 66.3% to 74.3% for a state-of-the-art CNN classifier trained with 50 MRIs of cognitively normal (CN) and 50 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and from 77.7% to 86.3% when trained with 243 CN and 210 AD while improving greatly sensitivity and specificity metrics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chadebec","given":"Clément"},{"family":"Thibeau-Sutre","given":"Elina"},{"family":"Burgos","given":"Ninon"},{"family":"Allassonnière","given":"Stéphanie"}],"citation-key":"chadebec_2021","container-title":"arXiv.org","DOI":"10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3185773","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,30]]},"language":"en","title":"Data Augmentation in High Dimensional Low Sample Size Setting Using a Geometry-Based Variational Autoencoder","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00026v2"},

Here, we present PrimeKG, a multimodal knowledge graph for precision medicine analyses. PrimeKG integrates 20 high-quality resources to describe 17,080 diseases with 4,050,249 relationships representing ten major biological scales, including disease-associated protein perturbations, biological processes and pathways, anatomical and phenotypic scales, and the entire range of approved drugs with their therapeutic action, considerably expanding previous efforts in disease-rooted knowledge graphs. PrimeKG contains an abundance of ‘indications’, ‘contradictions’, and ‘off-label use’ drug-disease edges that lack in other knowledge graphs and can support AI analyses of how drugs affect disease-associated networks. We supplement PrimeKG’s graph structure with language descriptions of clinical guidelines to enable multimodal analyses and provide instructions for continual updates of PrimeKG as new data become available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Chandak","given":"Payal"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Kexin"},{"family":"Zitnik","given":"Marinka"}],"citation-key":"chandak_2023","container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/s41597-023-01960-3","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","page":"67","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Building a knowledge graph to enable precision medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01960-3","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"chang_2024","abstract":"This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes and identify the predictive factors of a bladder-preservation approach incorporating maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) coupled with either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy for patients diagnosed with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who opted against definitive local therapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis on 53 MIBC (cT2-T3N0M0) patients who initially planned for neoadjuvant pembrolizumab or chemotherapy after maximal TURBT but later declined radical cystectomy and radiotherapy. Post-therapy clinical restaging and conservative bladder-preservation measures were employed. Clinical complete remission was defined as negative findings on cystoscopy with biopsy confirming the absence of malignancy if performed, negative urine cytology, and unremarkable cross-sectional imaging (either CT scan or MRI) following neoadjuvant therapy. Twenty-three patients received pembrolizumab, while thirty received chemotherapy. Our findings revealed that twenty-three (43.4%) patients achieved clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The complete remission rate was marginally higher in pembrolizumab group in comparison to chemotherapy group (52.1% vs. 36.7%, p = 0.26). After a median follow-up of 37.6 months, patients in the pembrolizumab group demonstrated a longer PFS (median, not reached vs. 20.2 months, p = 0.078) and OS (median, not reached vs. 26.8 months, p = 0.027) relative to those in chemotherapy group. Those achieving clinical complete remission post-neoadjuvant therapy also exhibited prolonged PFS (median, not reached vs. 10.2 months, p < 0.001) and OS (median, not reached vs. 24.4 months, p = 0.004). In the multivariate analysis, clinical complete remission subsequent to neoadjuvant therapy was independently associated with superior PFS and OS. In conclusion, bladder preservation emerges as a viable therapeutic strategy for a carefully selected cohort of MIBC patients without definitive local therapy, especially those achieving clinical complete remission following neoadjuvant treatment. For patients unfit for chemotherapy, pembrolizumab offers a promising alternative treatment option.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Pei-Hung"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hung-Yi"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Yueh-Shih"},{"family":"Su","given":"Po-Jung"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wen-Kuan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Cheng-Feng"},{"family":"Hsieh","given":"Jason Chia-Hsun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chun-Te"}],"citation-key":"chang_2024","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers16050894","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"894","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Effect of Clinical Complete Remission Following Neoadjuvant Pembrolizumab or Chemotherapy in Bladder-Preservation Strategy in Patients with Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Declining Definitive Local Therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/16/5/894","volume":"16"},

To remedy this problem, we focused on the biofluid most proximal to the disease, urine, and analyzed urine tumor DNA in 74 localized bladder cancer patients. We integrated ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) with urine cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (uCAPP-Seq) to achieve sensitive MRD detection and predict overall survival. Variant allele frequency, inferred tumor mutational burden, and copy number-derived tumor fraction levels in urine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) significantly predicted pathologic complete response status, far better than plasma ctDNA was able to. A random forest model incorporating these urine cfDNA-derived factors with leave-one-out cross-validation was 87% sensitive for predicting residual disease in reference to gold-standard surgical pathology. Both progression-free survival (HR = 3.00,\n              p\n               = 0.01) and overall survival (HR = 4.81,\n              p\n               = 0.009) were dramatically worse by Kaplan–Meier analysis for patients predicted by the model to have MRD, which was corroborated by Cox regression analysis. Additional survival analyses performed on muscle-invasive, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and held-out validation subgroups corroborated these findings. In summary, we profiled urine samples from 74 patients with localized bladder cancer and used urine cfDNA multi-omics to detect MRD sensitively and predict survival accurately.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Chauhan","given":"Pradeep S."},{"family":"Shiang","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Alahi","given":"Irfan"},{"family":"Sundby","given":"R.

This article describes a Bayesian approach to determining sample sizes in the sequential development of interventions. Description: Because sample sizes are related to the likelihood of detecting program effects, large samples are preferred. But in the design and development process that characterizes intervention research, smaller scale studies are usually required to justify more costly, larger scale studies. We present 4 scenarios designed to address common but complex questions regarding sample-size determination and the risk of observing misleading (e.g., false-positive) findings. From a Bayesian perspective, this article describes the use of decision rules composed of different target probabilities and prespecified effect sizes.

To make the Bayesian design more accessible, we elucidate this Bayesian approach with a R package to streamline a statistical plan, so biostatisticians and clinicians can easily integrate the design into clinical trial.\n\nMethods\nWe utilize a Bayesian framework using Bayesian posterior probability and predictive probability to build a R package and develop a statistical plan for the trial design. With pre-defined sample sizes, the approach employs the posterior probability with a threshold to calculate the minimum number of responders needed at end of the study to claim efficacy. Then the predictive probability is applied to evaluate future success at interim stages and form stopping rule at each stage.\n\nResults\nAn R package, ‘BayesianPredictiveFutility’, with associated graphical interface is developed for easy utilization of the trial design. The statistical tool generates a professional statistical plan with comprehensive results including a summary, details of study design, a series of tables and figures from stopping boundary for futility, Bayesian predictive probability, performance [probability of early termination (PET), type I error, and power], PET at each interim analysis, sensitivity analysis for predictive probability, posterior probability, sample size, and beta prior distribution. The statistical plan presents the methodology in a readable language fashion while preserving rigorous statistical arguments. The output formats (Word or PDF) are available to communicate with physicians or to be incorporated in the trial protocol.

  {"id":"chen_2021","abstract":"Objective: Standard-of-care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy. The inability to assess molecular residual disease (MRD) noninvasively limits our ability to offer bladder-sparing treatment. We seek to develop a liquid biopsy solution via urine tumor DNA (utDNA) analysis.Methods: We applied uCAPP-Seq, a targeted next-generation sequencing method for detecting utDNA, to urine cell-free DNA samples acquired on the day of curative-intent radical cystectomy from 42 patients with non-metastatic bladder cancer, 30 of whom had a confirmed diagnosis of MIBC and 19 of whom received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. utDNA mutational calling was performed noninvasively without tumor tissue sequencing knowledge. The overall utDNA level for each patient was represented by the non-silent mutation with the highest duplex-supported variant allele fraction after removing germline variants. Urine was similarly analyzed from 15 healthy donors. The concordance between urine cell-free DNA and tumor tissue was determined for a subset of patients. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) in utDNA MRD-positive patients was inferred from the number of mutations detected in urine cell-free DNA by applying a linear relationship derived from TCGA whole-exome sequencing of 409 MIBC tumors.Results: utDNA analysis revealed a median utDNA level of 0% in healthy donors and 2.4% in non-metastatic bladder cancer patients. Concordance between urine- and tumor-derived mutations, determined in 5 MIBC patients, was 87%. When patients were classified as those who had residual disease detected in their surgical sample (n = 16) compared to those who achieved a pathologic complete response (n = 26), median utDNA levels were 4.3% vs. 0%, respectively (P = 0.002). The lack of utDNA MRD detection was highly correlated with pathologic complete response by Fisher's exact test (P = 0.0001) with Youden's index-determined sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 81%. Moreover, utDNA MRD-positive patients exhibited significantly worse progression-free survival compared to utDNA MRD-negative patients (HR = 7.2; P = 0.03) with a median follow-up time of 200 days. Leveraging data from TCGA, the median inferred TMB in utDNA MRD-positive patients was 198 mutations per exome. We suggest that 58% of these patients with inferred TMB ≥ this level might have been candidates for early immune checkpoint blockade.Conclusion: The lack of utDNA MRD detection prior to curative-intent radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer correlated significantly with pathologic complete response. utDNA MRD detection status also correlated significantly with progression-free survival. Furthermore, utDNA results can be used to noninvasively infer TMB, which may facilitate the targeted use of adjuvant immunotherapy.Citation Format: Kevin Chen, Pradeep S. Chauhan, Ramandeep K.

  {"id":"chen_2023","abstract":"In recent decades, there has been growing interest in leveraging external data information for clinical development as it improves the efficiency of the design and inference of clinical trials when utilized properly and more importantly, alleviates potential ethical and recruitment challenges. When it is of interest to augment the concurrent study's control arm using external control data, the potential outcome heterogeneity across data sources, also known as prior-data conflict, should be accounted for. In addition, in the outcome modeling, inclusion of prognostic covariates that may have impact on the outcome can avoid efficiency loss or potential bias. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical modeling strategy incorporating covariate-adjusted meta-analytic predictive approach (cMAP) and also introduce a propensity score (PS) based sequential procedure that integrates the cMAP. In the simulation study, the proposed methods are found to have advantages in the estimation, power, and type I error control over the standard methods such as PS matching alone and hierarchical modeling that ignores the covariates.

In this article, we extend the notion of 'population attributable fraction' for the binary outcomes to the attributable risk function for the event times in prospective studies. A simple estimator of the time-varying attributable risk function is proposed under the proportional hazards model. Its inference procedures are established.

  {"id":"Chen2014","abstract":"Accurate gene model annotation of reference genomes is critical for making them useful. The modENCODE project has improved the D. melanogaster genome annotation by using deep and diverse high-throughput data. Since transcriptional activity that has been evolutionarily conserved is likely to have an advantageous function, we have performed large-scale interspecific comparisons to increase confidence in predicted annotations. To support comparative genomics, we filled in divergence gaps in the Drosophila phylogeny by generating draft genomes for eight new species. For comparative transcriptome analysis, we generated mRNA expression profiles on 81 samples from multiple tissues and developmental stages of 15 Drosophila species, and we performed cap analysis of gene expression in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. We also describe conservation of four distinct core promoter structures composed of combinations of elements at three positions. Overall, each type of genomic feature shows a characteristic divergence rate relative to neutral models, highlighting the value of multispecies alignment in annotating a target genome that should prove useful in the annotation of other high priority genomes, especially human and other mammalian genomes that are rich in noncoding sequences. We report that the vast majority of elements in the annotation are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that the annotation will be an important springboard for functional genetic testing by the Drosophila community.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhen-Xia"},{"family":"Sturgill","given":"David"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Jiaxin"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Huaiyang"},{"family":"Park","given":"Soo"},{"family":"Boley","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Ana Maria"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Anthony R"},{"family":"Plachetzki","given":"David C"},{"family":"FitzGerald","given":"Peter C"},{"family":"Artieri","given":"Carlo G"},{"family":"Atallah","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Barmina","given":"Olga"},{"family":"Brown","given":"James B"},{"family":"Blankenburg","given":"Kerstin P"},{"family":"Clough","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Gubbala","given":"Sai"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Jayaseelan","given":"Joy C"},{"family":"Kalra","given":"Divya"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yoo-Ah"},{"family":"Kovar","given":"Christie L"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sandra L"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mingmei"},{"family":"Malley","given":"James D"},{"family":"Malone","given":"John H"},{"family":"Mathew","given":"Tittu"},{"family":"Mattiuzzo","given":"Nicolas R"},{"family":"Munidasa","given":"Mala"},{"family":"Muzny","given":"Donna M"},{"family":"Ongeri","given":"Fiona"},{"family":"Perales","given":"Lora"},{"family":"Przytycka","given":"Teresa M"},{"family":"Pu","given":"Ling-Ling"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Garrett"},{"family":"Thornton","given":"Rebecca L"},{"family":"Saada","given":"Nehad"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Steven E"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Harold E"},{"family":"Vinson","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Warner","given":"Crystal B"},{"family":"Worley","given":"Kim C"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuan-Qing"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Xiaoyan"},{"family":"Cherbas","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kellis","given":"Manolis"},{"family":"Eisen","given":"Michael B"},{"family":"Piano","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Kionte","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Fitch","given":"David H"},{"family":"Sternberg","given":"Paul W"},{"family":"Cutter","given":"Asher D"},{"family":"Duff","given":"Michael O"},{"family":"Hoskins","given":"Roger A"},{"family":"Graveley","given":"Brenton R"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Richard A"},{"family":"Bickel","given":"Peter J"},{"family":"Kopp","given":"Artyom"},{"family":"Carninci","given":"Piero"},{"family":"Celniker","given":"Susan E"},{"family":"Oliver","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"Chen2014","container-title":"Genome Research","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"page":"1209-23","PMID":"24985915","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Comparative validation of the D. melanogaster modENCODE transcriptome annotation.","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"cheng_2020","abstract":"Biomarkers can be used to enrich a clinical trial for patients at higher risk for an outcome, a strategy termed \"prognostic enrichment.\" Methodology is needed to evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of trials with time-to-event endpoints such as survival. Key considerations when considering prognostic enrichment include: clinical trial sample size; the number of patients one must screen to enroll the trial; and total patient screening costs and total per-patient trial costs. The Biomarker Prognostic Enrichment Tool for Survival Outcomes (BioPETsurv) is a suite of methods for estimating these elements to evaluate a prognostic enrichment biomarker and/or plan a prognostically enriched clinical trial with a time-to-event primary endpoint. BioPETsurv allows investigators to analyze data on a candidate biomarker and potentially censored survival times. Alternatively, BioPETsurv can simulate data to match a particular clinical setting. BioPETsurv's data simulator enables investigators to explore the potential utility of a prognostic enrichment biomarker for their clinical setting. Results demonstrate that both modestly prognostic and strongly prognostic biomarkers can improve trial metrics such as reducing sample size or trial costs. In addition to the quantitative analysis provided by BioPETsurv, investigators should consider the generalizability of trial results and evaluate the ethics of trial eligibility criteria.

In the advanced disease setting, mutations in homologous recombination repair genes (eg, <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2</em>, <em>ATM</em>, <em>CHEK2</em>, <em>PALB2</em>) suggest candidacy for platinum chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor trials. Similarly, microsatellite instability and mismatch repair deficiency, which may arise in the setting of <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2</em>, <em>MSH6</em>, and <em>PMS2</em> mutations, suggest potential vulnerability to PD-1 inhibitors. Germline genetic testing has potential importance in the treatment and assessment of familial risk, and tumor-directed somatic sequencing may guide treatment decision-making. This review provides clinicians with knowledge of basic genetic terminology, awareness of the importance of family history of cancer (not limited to prostate cancer), contrasts between the different but potentially related objectives of germline versus somatic testing of tumor tissue, and indications for genetic counseling. Specific clinical scenarios, objectives of testing, and nature of the assays are reviewed.

  {"id":"chenGradientBoostingAlgorithm2013","abstract":"Survival analysis focuses on modeling and predicting the time to an event of interest. Many statistical models have been proposed for survival analysis. They often impose strong assumptions on hazard functions, which describe how the risk of an event changes over time depending on covariates associated with each individual. In particular, the prevalent proportional hazards model assumes that covariates are multiplicatively related to the hazard. Here we propose a nonparametric model for survival analysis that does not explicitly assume particular forms of hazard functions. Our nonparametric model utilizes an ensemble of regression trees to determine how the hazard function varies according to the associated covariates. The ensemble model is trained using a gradient boosting method to optimize a smoothed approximation of the concordance index, which is one of the most widely used metrics in survival model performance evaluation. We implemented our model in a software package called GBMCI (gradient boosting machine for concordance index) and benchmarked the performance of our model against other popular survival models with a large-scale breast cancer prognosis dataset. Our experiment shows that GBMCI consistently outperforms other methods based on a number of covariate settings. GBMCI is implemented in R and is freely available online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yifei"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Zhenyu"},{"family":"Mercola","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Xiaohui"}],"citation-key":"chenGradientBoostingAlgorithm2013","container-title":"Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","container-title-short":"Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine","DOI":"10.1155/2013/873595","ISSN":"1748-670X, 1748-6718","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-8","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Survival Analysis via Direct Optimization of Concordance Index","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/cmmm/2013/873595/","volume":"2013"},
  {"id":"chenHierarchicalBayesModel2014","abstract":"Some baseline patient factors, such as biomarkers, are useful in predicting patients’ responses to a new therapy. Identification of such factors is important in enhancing treatment outcomes, avoiding potentially toxic therapy that is destined to fail and improving the cost-effectiveness of treatment. Many of the biomarkers, such as gene expression, are measured on a continuous scale. A threshold of the biomarker is often needed to define a sensitive subset for making easy clinical decisions. A novel hierarchical Bayesian method is developed to make statistical inference simultaneously on the threshold and the treatment effect restricted on the sensitive subset defined by the biomarker threshold. In the proposed method, the threshold parameter is treated as a random variable that takes values with a certain probability distribution. The observed data are used to estimate parameters in the prior distribution for the threshold, so that the posterior is less dependent on the prior assumption. The proposed Bayesian method is evaluated through simulation studies. Compared to the existing approaches such as the profile likelihood method, which makes inferences about the threshold parameter using the bootstrap, the proposed method provides better finite sample properties in terms of the coverage probability of a 95% credible interval. The proposed method is also applied to a clinical trial of prostate cancer with the serum prostatic acid phosphatase (AP) biomarker. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, cell clustering and annotation become two crucial and fundamental procedures affecting other specific downstream analyses. Most existing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data clustering algorithms do not take into account the available cell annotation results on the same tissues or organisms from other laboratories. Nonetheless, such data could assist and guide the clustering process on the target dataset. Identifying marker genes through differential expression analysis to manually annotate large amounts of cells also costs labor and resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end cell supervised clustering and annotation framework called scAnCluster, which fully utilizes the cell type labels available from reference data to facilitate the cell clustering and annotation on the unlabeled target data. Our algorithm integrates deep supervised learning, self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques together, and it outperforms other customized scRNA-seq supervised clustering methods in both simulation and real data. It is particularly worth noting that our method performs well on the challenging task of discovering novel cell types that are absent in the reference data.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Zhai","given":"Yuyao"},{"family":"He","given":"Qiuyan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Weinan"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Minghua"}],"citation-key":"chenIntegratingDeepSupervised2020","container-title":"Genes","container-title-short":"Genes (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/genes11070792","ISSN":"2073-4425","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,14]]},"language":"eng","page":"E792","PMCID":"PMC7397036","PMID":"32674393","source":"PubMed","title":"Integrating Deep Supervised, Self-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning for Single-Cell RNA-seq Clustering and Annotation","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"chenPrognosticSignificanceBloodBased2021","abstract":"Purpose:\nWe recently reported the development of a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) targeted methylation (TM)-based sequencing approach for a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test that includes cancer signal origin prediction. Here, we evaluated the prognostic significance of cancer detection by the MCED test using longitudinal follow-up data.\n\nExperimental Design:\nAs part of a Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA) substudy, plasma cfDNA samples were sequenced using a TM approach, and machine learning classifiers predicted cancer status and cancer signal origin. Overall survival (OS) of cancer participants in the first 3 years of follow-up was evaluated in relation to cancer detection by the MCED test and clinical characteristics.\n\nResults:\nCancers not detected by the MCED test had significantly better OS (P < 0.0001) than cancers detected, even after accounting for other covariates, including clinical stage and method of clinical diagnosis (i.e., standard-of-care screening or clinical presentation with signs/symptoms). Additionally, cancers not detected by the MCED test had better OS than was expected when data were adjusted for age, stage, and cancer type from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. In cancers with current screening options, the MCED test also differentiated more aggressive cancers from less aggressive cancers (P < 0.0001).\n\nConclusions:\nCancer detection by the MCED test was prognostic beyond clinical stage and method of diagnosis. Cancers not detected by the MCED test had better prognosis than cancers detected and SEER-based expected survival. Cancer detection and prognosis may be linked by the underlying biological factor of tumor fraction in cfDNA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaoji"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Hubbell","given":"Earl"},{"family":"Kurtzman","given":"Kathryn N."},{"family":"Oxnard","given":"Geoffrey R."},{"family":"Venn","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Melton","given":"Collin"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Christina A."},{"family":"Shaknovich","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Meixiong","given":"Gerry"},{"family":"Seiden","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Klein","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Fung","given":"Eric T."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Minetta C."}],"citation-key":"chenPrognosticSignificanceBloodBased2021","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin Cancer Res","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-0417","ISSN":"1078-0432","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"4221-4229","PMCID":"PMC9401481","PMID":"34088722","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Prognostic Significance of Blood-Based Multi-cancer Detection in Plasma Cell-Free DNA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9401481/","volume":"27"},

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records.

  {"id":"chiou_2019","abstract":"Truncation is a mechanism that permits observation of selected subjects from a source population; subjects are excluded if their event times are not contained within subject-specific intervals. Standard survival analysis methods for estimation of the distribution of the event time require quasi-independence [1] of failure and truncation. When quasi-independence does not hold, alternative estimation procedures are required; currently, there is a copula model approach that makes strong modeling assumptions, and a transformation model approach [2] that does not allow for right censoring.

Unlike normal cells, tumor cells are heterogeneous as a combination of dominant and minor subclones with distinct copy number profiles. Estimating the clonal proportion and identifying mainclone and subclone genotypes across the genome are important for understanding tumor progression. Several ASCNA tools have recently been developed, but they have been limited to the identification of subclone regions, and not the genotype of subclones. In this article, we propose subHMM, a hidden Markov model-based approach that estimates both subclone region and region-specific subclone genotype and clonal proportion. We specify a hidden state variable representing the conglomeration of clonal genotype and subclone status. We propose a two-step algorithm for parameter estimation, where in the first step, a standard hidden Markov model with this conglomerated state variable is fit. Then, in the second step, region-specific estimates of the clonal proportions are obtained by maximizing region-specific pseudo-likelihoods. We apply subHMM to study renal cell carcinoma datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, we conduct simulation studies that show the good performance of the proposed approach.

We addressed the prognostic and predictive impact of ultra-deep sequencing of cell-free DNA in patients before and after cystectomy and during chemotherapy.\nPatients and Methods\n\nWe included 68 patients with localized advanced bladder cancer. Patient-specific somatic mutations, identified by whole-exome sequencing, were used to assess circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by ultra-deep sequencing (median, 105,000×) of plasma DNA. Plasma samples (n = 656) were procured at diagnosis, during chemotherapy, before cystectomy, and during surveillance. Expression profiling was performed for tumor subtype and immune signature analyses.\nResults\n\nPresence of ctDNA was highly prognostic at diagnosis before chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 29.1; P = .001). After cystectomy, ctDNA analysis correctly identified all patients with metastatic relapse during disease monitoring (100% sensitivity, 98% specificity). A median lead time over radiographic imaging of 96 days was observed. In addition, for high-risk patients (ctDNA positive before or during treatment), the dynamics of ctDNA during chemotherapy was associated with disease recurrence (P = .023), whereas pathologic downstaging was not. Analysis of tumor-centric biomarkers showed that mutational processes (signature 5) were associated with pathologic downstaging (P = .024); however, no significant correlation for tumor subtypes, DNA damage response mutations, and other biomarkers was observed. Our results suggest that ctDNA analysis is better associated with treatment efficacy compared with other available methods.\nConclusion\n\nctDNA assessment for early risk stratification, therapy monitoring, and early relapse detection in bladder cancer is feasible and provides a basis for clinical studies that evaluate early therapeutic interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Christensen","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Birkenkamp-Demtröder","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Sethi","given":"Himanshu"},{"family":"Shchegrova","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Salari","given":"Raheleh"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Iver"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hsin-Ta"},{"family":"Knudsen","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Lamy","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Lindskrog","given":"Sia Viborg"},{"family":"Taber","given":"Ann"},{"family":"Balcioglu","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Vang","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Assaf","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Shruti"},{"family":"Tin","given":"Antony S."},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Ramya"},{"family":"Hafez","given":"Dina"},{"family":"Reinert","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Ram","given":"Rosalyn"},{"family":"Dashner","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Rabinowitz","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Billings","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Sigurjonsson","given":"Styrmir"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Claus Lindbjerg"},{"family":"Swenerton","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Aleshin","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Agerbæk","given":"Mads"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Cheng-Ho Jimmy"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Jørgen Bjerggaard"},{"family":"Dyrskjøt","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"christensen_2019","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.18.02052","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,20]]},"page":"1547-1557","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"ascopubs.org (Atypon)","title":"Early Detection of Metastatic Relapse and Monitoring of Therapeutic Efficacy by Ultra-Deep Sequencing of Plasma Cell-Free DNA in Patients With Urothelial Bladder Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.18.02052","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"chu:2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The basket trial evaluates the treatment effect of a targeted therapy in patients with the same genetic or molecular aberration, regardless of their cancer types. Bayesian hierarchical modeling has been proposed to adaptively borrow information across cancer types to improve the statistical power of basket trials. Although conceptually attractive, research has shown that Bayesian hierarchical models cannot appropriately determine the degree of information borrowing and may lead to substantially inflated type I error rates.\nMETHODS: We propose a novel calibrated Bayesian hierarchical model approach to evaluate the treatment effect in basket trials. In our approach, the shrinkage parameter that controls information borrowing is not regarded as an unknown parameter. Instead, it is defined as a function of a similarity measure of the treatment effect across tumor subgroups. The key is that the function is calibrated using simulation such that information is strongly borrowed across subgroups if their treatment effects are similar and barely borrowed if the treatment effects are heterogeneous.\nRESULTS: The simulation study shows that our method has substantially better controlled type I error rates than the Bayesian hierarchical model. In some scenarios, for example, when the true response rate is between the null and alternative, the type I error rate of the proposed method can be inflated from 10% up to 20%, but is still better than that of the Bayesian hierarchical model.\nLIMITATION: The proposed design assumes a binary endpoint. Extension of the proposed design to ordinal and time-to-event endpoints is worthy of further investigation.\nCONCLUSION: The calibrated Bayesian hierarchical model provides a practical approach to design basket trials with more flexibility and better controlled type I error rates than the Bayesian hierarchical model.

This review covers the increasing risk of PCa and the differences in response to targeted therapy that are related to specific gene variations. We believe that genomic evaluations will be useful for guiding PCa risk stratification, screening, and treatment. We searched the PubMed and MEDLINE databases for articles related to genomic testing for PCa that were published in 2020 or earlier. There is increasing evidence that germline mutations in DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1/2 or ATM, are closely related to the development and aggressiveness of PCa. Targeted prostate-specific antigen screening based on the presence of germline alterations in DNA repair genes is recommend to achieve an early diagnosis of PCa. In cases of localized PCa, even if it has a favorable risk classification, patients under active surveillance with these gene alterations are likely to develop aggressive PCa. Thus, active treatment may be preferable to active surveillance for these patients. In cases of metastatic castration–resistant PCa, BRCA1/2 and DNA mismatch repair genes may be useful biomarkers for predicting the response to androgen receptor–targeting agents, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, platinum chemotherapy, prostate-specific membrane antigen–targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radium-223.

We explain each of the following types of interim analyses: efficacy, futility, safety, and sample size re-estimation, and we provide the reader with reasoning, examples, and implications for each. We emphasize that while the types of interim analyses employed may differ depending on the nature of the study, we would always recommend prespecification of the interim analytic plan to the extent possible with risk mitigation and trial integrity remaining a priority. Finally, we posit that interim analyses should be used as tools to help the DSMB make informed decisions in the context of the overarching study. They should generally not be deemed binding, and they should not be reviewed in isolation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ciolino","given":"Jody D."},{"family":"Kaizer","given":"Alexander M."},{"family":"Bonner","given":"Lauren Balmert"}],"citation-key":"ciolinoGuidanceInterimAnalysis2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical and Translational Science","container-title-short":"J Clin Transl Sci","DOI":"10.1017/cts.2023.552","ISSN":"2059-8661","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"e124","PMCID":"PMC10260346","PMID":"37313374","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Guidance on interim analysis methods in clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10260346/","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"clareExplainableArtificialIntelligence2022","abstract":"The trustworthiness of neural networks is often challenged because they lack the ability to express uncertainty and explain their skill. This can be problematic given the increasing use of neural networks in high stakes decision-making such as in climate change applications. We address both issues by successfully implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), where parameters are distributions rather than deterministic, and applying novel implementations of explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The uncertainty analysis from the BNN provides a comprehensive overview of the prediction more suited to practitioners' needs than predictions from a classical neural network. Using a BNN means we can calculate the entropy (i.e., uncertainty) of the predictions and determine if the probability of an outcome is statistically significant. To enhance trustworthiness, we also spatially apply the two XAI techniques of Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values. These XAI methods reveal the extent to which the BNN is suitable and/or trustworthy. Using two techniques gives a more holistic view of BNN skill and its uncertainty, as LRP considers neural network parameters, whereas SHAP considers changes to outputs. We verify these techniques using comparison with intuition from physical theory. The differences in explanation identify potential areas where new physical theory guided studies are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Clare","given":"Mariana C.

Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI’s decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Clivio","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Regier","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Gayoso","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Michael I."},{"family":"Yosef","given":"Nir"}],"citation-key":"clivioDetectingZeroInflatedGenes2019","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/794875","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,10]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"coley:2023","abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in clinical prediction models for rare outcomes such as suicide, psychiatric hospitalizations, and opioid overdose. Accurate model validation is needed to guide model selection and decisions about whether and how prediction models should be used. Split-sample estimation and validation of clinical prediction models, in which data are divided into training and testing sets, may reduce predictive accuracy and precision of validation. Using all data for estimation and validation increases sample size for both procedures, but validation must account for overfitting, or optimism. Our study compared split-sample and entire-sample methods for estimating and validating a suicide prediction model.\nMETHODS: We compared performance of random forest models estimated in a sample of 9,610,318 mental health visits (\"entire-sample\") and in a 50% subset (\"split-sample\") as evaluated in a prospective validation sample of 3,754,137 visits. We assessed optimism of three internal validation approaches: for the split-sample prediction model, validation in the held-out testing set and, for the entire-sample model, cross-validation and bootstrap optimism correction.\nRESULTS: The split-sample and entire-sample prediction models showed similar prospective performance; the area under the curve, AUC, and 95% confidence interval was 0.81 (0.77-0.85) for both. Performance estimates evaluated in the testing set for the split-sample model (AUC = 0.85 [0.82-0.87]) and via cross-validation for the entire-sample model (AUC = 0.83 [0.81-0.85]) accurately reflected prospective performance. Validation of the entire-sample model with bootstrap optimism correction overestimated prospective performance (AUC = 0.88 [0.86-0.89]). Measures of classification accuracy, including sensitivity and positive predictive value at the 99th, 95th, 90th, and 75th percentiles of the risk score distribution, indicated similar conclusions: bootstrap optimism correction overestimated classification accuracy in the prospective validation set.\nCONCLUSIONS: While previous literature demonstrated the validity of bootstrap optimism correction for parametric models in small samples, this approach did not accurately validate performance of a rare-event prediction model estimated with random forests in a large clinical dataset. Cross-validation of prediction models estimated with all available data provides accurate independent validation while maximizing sample size.","author":[{"family":"Coley","given":"R.

Although it has long been known that radiation risk is modified by factors such as sex, age, and time, it is now apparent that radiation risk may also be modified by other risk factors, such as smoking, inflammation, genotype, and certain pathogens. Even apart from considerations of etiological interaction, the relative contribution of radiation to total burden of disease or death may depend on the level of background (spontaneous) risk of disease or death owing to those other factors if the joint effects do not multiply. Therefore, ignoring those other factors in assessing probability of causation for radiation (attributable fraction in epidemiological data) involves making a strong assumption about the joint effects.

It is likely that persistent tumors differentially engage inherent patterns–here ‘Archetypes’–of the immune system, to both benefit from a tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and to disengage tumor-targeting. To discover dominant immune system archetypes, the Immunoprofiler Initiative (IPI) processed 364 individual tumors across 12 cancer types using standardized protocols. Computational clustering of flow cytometry and transcriptomic data obtained from cell sub compartments uncovered archetypes that exist across indications. These Immune composition-based archetypes differentiate tumors based upon unique immune and tumor gene-expression patterns. Archetypes discovered this way also tie closely to well-established classifications of tumor biology. The IPI resource provides a template for understanding cancer immunity as a collection of dominant patterns of immune infiltration and provides a rational path forward to learn how to modulate these patterns to improve therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Combes","given":"Alexis J."},{"family":"Samad","given":"Bushra"},{"family":"Tsui","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Chew","given":"Nayvin W."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Reeder","given":"Gabriella C."},{"family":"Kushnoor","given":"Divyashree"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Brittany"},{"family":"Barczac","given":"Andrea J."},{"family":"Adkisson","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Austin"},{"family":"Naser","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Kevin C."},{"family":"Courau","given":"Tristan"},{"family":"Hammoudi","given":"Taymour"},{"family":"Arguëllo","given":"Rafael J"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Arjun Arkal"},{"family":"Olshen","given":"Adam B."},{"literal":"The Immunoprofiler consortium"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Cathy"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Katelyn C."},{"family":"Kelley","given":"Robin K."},{"family":"Chapman","given":"Jocelyn S."},{"family":"Attreya","given":"Chloe E."},{"family":"Patel","given":"Amar"},{"family":"Daud","given":"Adil I."},{"family":"Ha","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Aaron A."},{"family":"Kratz","given":"Johannes R."},{"family":"Collisson","given":"Eric A."},{"family":"Fragiadakis","given":"Gabriela K"},{"family":"Erle","given":"David J."},{"family":"Boissonnas","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Asthana","given":"Saurabh"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Krummel","given":"Matthew F."}],"citation-key":"combesPanCancerCensusDominant2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.04.26.441344","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,27]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Immunology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Pan-Cancer Census of Dominant Tumor Immune Archetypes","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.04.26.441344"},

We surveyed the immune compartment of 16 tissues from 12 adult donors by single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing generating a dataset of  360,000 cells. To systematically resolve immune cell heterogeneity across tissues, we developed CellTypist, a machine learning tool for rapid and precise cell type annotation. Using this approach, combined with detailed curation, we determined the tissue distribution of finely phenotyped immune cell types, revealing hitherto unappreciated tissue-specific features and clonal architecture of T and B cells. Our multitissue approach lays the foundation for identifying highly resolved immune cell types by leveraging a common reference dataset, tissue-integrated expression analysis, and antigen receptor sequencing. The human immune system is composed of many different cell types spread across the entire body, but little is currently known about the fine-grained variations in these cell types across organs. Using single-cell genomics, Domínguez Conde et al. examined the gene expression profile of more than 300,000 individual immune cells extracted from 16 different tissues in 12 deceased adult organ donors (see the Perspective by Liu and Zhang). Cell identity was assigned using CellTypist, an automated cell classification tool designed by the authors.

  {"id":"Coronini-Cronberg2013","abstract":"Objectives To demonstrate potential uses of nationally collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data to estimate cost-effectiveness of hernia surgery. Design Cost-utility model populated with national PROMs, National Reference Cost and Hospital Episodes Statistics data. Setting Hospitals in England that provided elective inguinal hernia repair surgery for NHS patients between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. Participants Patients >18 years undergoing NHS-funded elective hernia surgery in English hospitals who completed PROMs questionnaires. Main outcome measures Change in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) following surgery; cost per QALY of surgery by acute provider hospital; health gain and cost per QALY by surgery type received (laparoscopic or open hernia repair). Results The casemix-adjusted, discounted (at 3.5%) and degraded (over 25 years) mean change in QALYs following elective hernia repair surgery is 0.826 (95% CI, 0.793-0.859) compared to a counterfactual of no treatment. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery show a significantly greater gain in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index change, 0.0915; 95% CI, 0.0850-0.0979) with an estimated gain of 0.923 QALYS (95% CI, 0.859-0.988) compared to those having open repair (EQ-5D index change, 0.0806; 95% CI, 0.0771-0.0841) at 0.817 QALYS (95% CI, 0.782-0.852). The average cost of hernia surgery in England is £1554, representing a mean cost per QALY of £1881. The mean cost of laparoscopic and open hernia surgery is equivocal (£1421 vs. £1426 respectively) but laparoscopies appear to offer higher cost-utility at £1540 per QALY, compared to £1746 per QALY for open surgery. Conclusions Routine PROMs data derived from NHS patients could be usefully analyzed to estimate health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of interventions to inform decision-making. This analysis suggests elective hernia surgery offers value-for-money, and laparoscopic repair is more clinically effective and generates higher cost-utility than open surgery.","author":[{"family":"Coronini-Cronberg","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Appleby","given":"John"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"Coronini-Cronberg2013","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine","event-place":"The King's Fund, London, W1G 0AN, UK.","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"number":"7","page":"278-287","publisher-place":"The King's Fund, London, W1G 0AN, UK.","title":"Application of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data to estimate cost-effectiveness of hernia surgery in England.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=23759893&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"106"},

  {"id":"Costantino2009","abstract":"RNA-binding protein HuR binds U- or AU-rich sequences in the 3'-untranslated regions of target mRNAs, stabilizing them and/or modulating their translation. Given the links of HuR with cancer, we studied the consequences of modulating HuR levels in pancreatic cancer cells. HuR-overexpressing cancer cells, in some instances, are roughly up to 30-fold more sensitive to treatment with gemcitabine, the main chemotherapeutic component of treatment regimens for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), compared with control cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, HuR associates with deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) mRNA, which encodes the enzyme that metabolizes and thereby activates gemcitabine. Gemcitabine exposure to pancreatic cancer cells enriches the association between HuR and dCK mRNA and increases cytoplasmic HuR levels. Accordingly, HuR overexpression elevates, whereas HuR silencing reduces, dCK protein expression in pancreatic cancer cells. In a clinical correlate study of gemcitabine treatment, we found a 7-fold increase in risk of mortality in PDA patients with low cytoplasmic HuR levels compared with patients with high HuR levels, after adjusting for other treatments and demographic variables. These data support the notion that HuR is a key mediator of gemcitabine efficacy in cancer cells, at least in part through its ability to regulate dCK levels posttranscriptionally. We propose that HuR levels in PDA modulate the therapeutic efficacy of gemcitabine, thus serving as a marker of the clinical utility of this common chemotherapeutic agent and a potential target for intervention in pancreatic cancer.","author":[{"family":"Costantino","given":"Christina L"},{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Kuwano","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Cozzitorto","given":"Joseph A"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Eugene P"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Keen","given":"Judith C"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Charles J"},{"family":"Gorospe","given":"Myriam"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jonathan R"}],"citation-key":"Costantino2009","container-title":"Cancer Research","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"page":"4567-72","PMID":"19487279","publisher-place":"United States","title":"The role of HuR in gemcitabine efficacy in pancreatic cancer: HuR Up-regulates the expression of the gemcitabine metabolizing enzyme deoxycytidine kinase.","type":"article-journal","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"coxPracticalDivergenceMeasure2016","abstract":"This paper introduces a new simple divergence measure between two survival distributions. For two groups of patients, the divergence measure between their associated survival distributions is based on the integral of the absolute difference in probabilities that a patient from one group dies at time t and a patient from the other group survives beyond time t and vice versa. In the case of non-crossing hazard functions, the divergence measure is closely linked to the Harrell concordance index, C, the Mann-Whitney test statistic and the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve. The measure can be used in a dynamic way where the divergence between two survival distributions from time zero up to time t is calculated enabling real-time monitoring of treatment differences. The divergence can be found for theoretical survival distributions or can be estimated non-parametrically from survival data using Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survivor functions. The estimator of the divergence is shown to be generally unbiased and approximately normally distributed. For the case of proportional hazards, the constituent parts of the divergence measure can be used to assess the proportional hazards assumption. The use of the divergence measure is illustrated on the survival of pancreatic cancer patients.

To obtain insights from the large data sets produced, statistical methods, including machine learning, are routinely applied. For a quantity of interest, many of these approaches only produce a point estimate, such as a mean, leaving little room for more nuanced interpretations. By contrast, Bayesian statistics allows quantification of uncertainty through the use of probability distributions. These probability distributions enable scientists to ask complex questions of their proteomics data. Bayesian statistics also offers a modular framework for data analysis by making dependencies between data and parameters explicit. Hence, specifying complex hierarchies of parameter dependencies is straightforward in the Bayesian framework. This allows us to use a statistical methodology which equals, rather than neglects, the sophistication of experimental design and instrumentation present in proteomics. Here, we review Bayesian methods applied to proteomics, demonstrating their potential power, alongside the challenges posed by adopting this new statistical framework. To illustrate our review, we give a walk-through of the development of a Bayesian model for dynamic organic orthogonal phase-separation (OOPS) data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Crook","given":"Oliver M."},{"family":"Chung","given":"Chun-wa"},{"family":"Deane","given":"Charlotte M."}],"citation-key":"crookChallengesOpportunitiesBayesian2022","container-title":"Journal of Proteome Research","container-title-short":"J.

An IPD meta-analysis can be achieved by either a two-stage or a one-stage approach, depending on whether the trials are analysed separately or simultaneously. A range of one-stage hierarchical Cox models have been previously proposed, but these are known to be computationally intensive and are not currently available in all standard statistical software.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) holds promise as a biomarker in this setting.\nObjective\nTo review the evidence of ctDNA as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in the perioperative treatment of MIBC.\nEvidence acquisition\nWe systematically reviewed the literature using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. We included prospective studies investigating neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy for MIBC (T2-T4a, any N, and M0) treated with radical cystectomy. We reported ctDNA results to monitor and/or predict disease status, relapse, and progression. The research retrieved 223 records. Six papers were considered for this review based on prespecified inclusion criteria.\nEvidence synthesis\nOur review confirms the prognostic role of ctDNA after cystectomy and shows a potential predictive benefit in using neoadjuvant chemotherapy and preoperative immunotherapy. Circulating tumor DNA was used to monitor recurrence, and changes in ctDNA status anticipated radiological progression with a median difference of time from 101 to 932 d. A subgroup analysis of the phase 3 Imvigor010 trial showed that only ctDNA-positive patients treated with atezolizumab had an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 3.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.44–4.62).

The learned cellular representations encode high-level biologically relevant information without requiring individual cell segmentation, which is aggregated into patient-level feature vectors by using a locality-constrained linear coding (LLC)-based bag of words (BoW) encoding algorithm. 2) The second component is a Cox proportional hazards model with an elastic net penalty for robust feature selection and survival analysis. 3) The third commponent is a biomarker interpretation module that can help localize the image regions that contribute to the survival model’s decision. Extensive experiments show that the proposed survival model has excellent predictive power for a public (i.e., The Cancer Genome Atlas) lung cancer dataset in terms of two commonly used metrics: log-rank test (\n                p\n                -value) of the Kaplan-Meier estimate and concordance index (\n                c\n                -index).\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              In this work, we have proposed a segmentation-free survival analysis system that takes advantage of the recently emerging deep learning framework and well-studied survival analysis methods such as the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, we provide an approach to visualize the discovered biomarkers, which can serve as concrete evidence supporting the survival model’s decision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Cui","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hansheng"},{"family":"Hui","given":"Wenli"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sitong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Yuxin"},{"family":"Bo","given":"Qirong"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"cuiDeepLearningbasedFramework2020","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-020-3431-z","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"112","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A deep learning-based framework for lung cancer survival analysis with biomarker interpretation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3431-z","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"Culp2010","abstract":"Ensemble algorithms have been historically categorized into two separate paradigms, boosting and random forests, which differ significantly in the way each ensemble is constructed. Boosting algorithms represent one extreme, where an iterative greedy optimization strategy, weak learners (e.g., small classification trees), and stage weights are employed to target difficult-to-classify regions in the training space. On the other extreme, random forests rely on randomly selected features and complex learners (learners that exhibit low bias, e.g., large regression trees) to classify well over the entire training data. Because the approach is not targeting the next learner for inclusion, it tends to provide a natural robustness to noisy labels. In this work, we introduce the ensemble bridge algorithm, which is capable of transitioning between boosting and random forests using a regularization parameter nu in [0,1]. Because the ensemble bridge algorithm is a compromise between the greedy nature of boosting and the randomness present in random forests, it yields robust performance in the presence of a noisy response and superior performance in the presence of a clean response. Often, drug discovery data (e.g., computational chemistry data) have varying levels of noise. Hence, this method enables a practitioner to employ a single method to evaluate ensemble performance. The method's robustness is verified across a variety of data sets where the algorithm repeatedly yields better performance than either boosting or random forests alone. Finally, we provide diagnostic tools for the new algorithm, including a measure of variable importance and an observational clustering tool.","author":[{"family":"Culp","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Kjell"},{"family":"Michailidis","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"Culp2010","container-title":"Journal of chemical information and modeling","event-place":"Department of Statistics, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA. mculp@stat.wvu.edu","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"number":"2","page":"309-316","publisher-place":"Department of Statistics, West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia 26506, USA. mculp@stat.wvu.edu","title":"The ensemble bridge algorithm: a new modeling tool for drug discovery problems.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=20121044&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"50"},

Implementation of these alternative grading methods require developing specific, transparent, and assessable standards. Moving away from traditional methods also requires a mindset shift for how both students and instructors approach assessment. While providing multiple opportunities is important for learning in any course, these methods are particularly relevant to an upper level mathematical statistics course where topics covered often provide an additional challenge for students as they lie at the intersection of both theory and application. By providing multiple opportunities, students have the space for constructive failure as they tackle learning both a conceptual understanding of statistics and the supporting mathematical theory.

Though observational studies and RCTs often provide comparable estimates, the questioning of observational analyses has recently intensified because of randomized-observational discrepancies regarding the effect of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on coronary heart disease. Reanalyses of observational data that excluded prevalent users of hormone replacement therapy led to attenuated discrepancies, which begs the question of whether exclusion of prevalent users should be generally recommended. In the current study, the authors evaluated the effect of excluding prevalent users of statins in a meta-analysis of observational studies of persons with cardiovascular disease. The pooled, multivariate-adjusted mortality hazard ratio for statin use was 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65, 0.91) in 4 studies that compared incident users with nonusers, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.78) in 13 studies that compared a combination of prevalent and incident users with nonusers, and 0.54 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.66) in 13 studies that compared prevalent users with nonusers. The corresponding hazard ratio from 18 RCTs was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.91).

  {"id":"dandl_2024","abstract":"The estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects has attracted considerable interest in many disciplines, most prominently in medicine and economics. Contemporary research has so far primarily focused on continuous and binary responses where heterogeneous treatment effects are traditionally estimated by a linear model, which allows the estimation of constant or heterogeneous effects even under certain model misspeciﬁcations. More complex models for survival, count, or ordinal outcomes require stricter assumptions to reliably estimate the treatment effect. Most importantly, the noncollapsibility issue necessitates the joint estimation of treatment and prognostic effects. Model-based forests allow simultaneous estimation of covariate-dependent treatment and prognostic effects, but only for randomized trials. In this paper, we propose modiﬁcations to model-based forests to address the confounding issue in observational data. In particular, we evaluate an orthogonalization strategy originally proposed by Robinson (1988, Econometrica) in the context of model-based forests targeting heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in generalized linear models and transformation models. We found that this strategy reduces confounding effects in a simulated study with various outcome distributions. We demonstrate the practical aspects of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation for survival and ordinal outcomes by an assessment of the potentially heterogeneous effect of Riluzole on the progress of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dandl","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Bender","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Hothorn","given":"Torsten"}],"citation-key":"dandl_2024","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/09622802231224628","ISSN":"0962-2802, 1477-0334","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"en","page":"392-413","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation for observational data using model-based forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09622802231224628","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"dandlWhatMakesForestBased2022","abstract":"Estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) is of prime importance in many disciplines, ranging from personalized medicine to economics among many others. Random forests have been shown to be a flexible and powerful approach to HTE estimation in both randomized trials and observational studies. In particular \"causal forests\", introduced by Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (2019), along with the R implementation in package grf were rapidly adopted. A related approach, called \"model-based forests\", that is geared towards randomized trials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive variables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (2018) along with a modular implementation in the R package model4you. Here, we present a unifying view that goes beyond the theoretical motivations and investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful and how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests. To do so, we show that both methods can be understood in terms of the same parameters and model assumptions for an additive model under L2 loss. This theoretical insight allows us to implement several flavors of \"model-based causal forests\" and dissect their different elements in silico. The original causal forests and model-based forests are compared with the new blended versions in a benchmark study exploring both randomized trials and observational settings. In the randomized setting, both approaches performed akin. If confounding was present in the data generating process, we found local centering of the treatment indicator with the corresponding propensities to be the main driver for good performance. Local centering of the outcome was less important, and might be replaced or enhanced by simultaneous split selection with respect to both prognostic and predictive effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dandl","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Hothorn","given":"Torsten"},{"family":"Seibold","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Sverdrup","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Wager","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Zeileis","given":"Achim"}],"citation-key":"dandlWhatMakesForestBased2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2206.10323","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"number":"arXiv:2206.10323","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"What Makes Forest-Based Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimators Work?","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10323"},
  {"id":"dangCausalRoadmapGenerating2023","abstract":"Increasing emphasis on the use of real-world evidence (RWE) to support clinical policy and regulatory decision-making has led to a proliferation of guidance, advice, and frameworks from regulatory agencies, academia, professional societies, and industry. A broad spectrum of studies use real-world data (RWD) to produce RWE, ranging from randomized controlled trials with outcomes assessed using RWD to fully observational studies. Yet many RWE study proposals lack sufficient detail to evaluate adequacy, and many analyses of RWD suffer from implausible assumptions, other methodological flaws, or inappropriate interpretations. The Causal Roadmap is an explicit, itemized, iterative process that guides investigators to pre-specify analytic study designs; it addresses a wide range of guidance within a single framework. By requiring transparent evaluation of causal assumptions and facilitating objective comparisons of design and analysis choices based on pre-specified criteria, the Roadmap can help investigators to evaluate the quality of evidence that a given study is likely to produce, specify a study to generate high-quality RWE, and communicate effectively with regulatory agencies and other stakeholders. This paper aims to disseminate and extend the Causal Roadmap framework for use by clinical and translational researchers, with companion papers demonstrating application of the Causal Roadmap for specific use cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Dang","given":"Lauren E."},{"family":"Gruber","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Dahabreh","given":"Issa"},{"family":"Stuart","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Brian D."},{"family":"Wyss","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Díaz","given":"Iván"},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Debashis"},{"family":"Kıcıman","given":"Emre"},{"family":"Alemayehu","given":"Demissie"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Vossen","given":"Carla Y."},{"family":"Huml","given":"Raymond A."},{"family":"Ravn","given":"Henrik"},{"family":"Kvist","given":"Kajsa"},{"family":"Pratley","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Mei-Chiung"},{"family":"Pennello","given":"Gene"},{"family":"Martin","given":"David"},{"family":"Waddy","given":"Salina P."},{"family":"Barr","given":"Charles E."},{"family":"Akacha","given":"Mouna"},{"family":"Buse","given":"John B."},{"family":"Laan","given":"Mark","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Petersen","given":"Maya"}],"citation-key":"dangCausalRoadmapGenerating2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2305.06850","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,11]]},"number":"arXiv:2305.06850","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Causal Roadmap for Generating High-Quality Real-World Evidence","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06850"},

Whilst the use of scRNA-seq to understand target biology is well established, the impact of single-cell data in increasing the probability of candidate therapeutic targets to successfully advance from research to clinic has not been fully characterized. Inspired by previous work on an association between genetic evidence and clinical success, we used retrospective analysis of known drug target genes to identify potential predictors of target clinical success from scRNA-seq data. Particularly, we investigated whether successful drug targets are associated with cell type specific expression in a disease-relevant tissue (cell type specificity) or cell type specific over-expression in disease patients compared to healthy controls (disease cell specificity). Analysing scRNA-seq data across 30 diseases and 13 tissues, we found that both classes of scRNA-seq support significantly increase the odds of clinical success for gene-disease pairs. We estimate that combined they could approximately triple the chances of a target reaching phase III. Importantly, scRNA-seq analysis identifies a larger and complementary target space to that of direct genetic evidence. In particular, scRNA-seq support is more likely to prioritize therapeutically tractable classes of genes such as membrane-bound proteins. Our study suggests that scRNA-seq-derived information on cell type- and disease-specific expression can be leveraged to identify tractable and disease-relevant targets, with increased probability of success in the clinic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dann","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Teeple","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Elmentaite","given":"Rasa"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Kerstin B."},{"family":"Gaglia","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Nestle","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Savova","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Rinaldis","given":"Emanuele","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Teichmann","given":"Sarah A."}],"citation-key":"dann_2024","DOI":"10.1101/2024.04.04.24305313","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,5]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

  {"id":"dasgupta_2024","abstract":"Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technology transformed our understanding of biology at the cell level. Inferring cell types provide insights into the relative abundance of, and genomic differences between, different cell types. Current methods leverage known cell type markers and genomic similarity measures to attribute cell types to groups of cells.We present a scalable machine learning-based pipeline that can leverage high quality reference annotation data to infer cell types quickly for multiple scRNA-seq experimental samples. This pipeline leverages two machine learning technologies: variational autoencoders (VAE) to create a low-dimensional representation of the reference transcriptome; and, supervised learning methods that use this representation to learn cell types from the reference data. This pipeline can quickly score new experimental data using GPU-enabled computing platforms and provide probabilities of a cell being each cell type present in the reference data.This novel pipeline is evaluated using 5 public reference data sets. We evaluate whether VAE-based representations benefit supervised learning, compared to PCA and t-SNE. We next evaluate different supervised learning methods for predictive performance. Finally, we compare the pipeline’s performance with commonly-used cell type prediction algorithms (Seurat, scANVI). We find that using a VAE is generally better than both PCA and t-SNE for feature generation to predict cell type. Using the VAE representation, there is no significant difference in accuracy between logistic regression and other supervised learning algorithms. Finally, using logistic regression as the learning machine, this pipeline is as accurate as Seurat and better than scANVI, while running about 2-5x faster than Seurat.Table 1 Balanced accuracy (%) from leave-one-subject-out cross-validation across 5 public data sets.

  {"id":"Dasgupta:2019","abstract":"Direct comparison trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) increasingly use changes in continuous disease activity measures as endpoints. However, the between-arm differences in these scores that are clinically meaningful are uncertain. To aid interpretation of clinical trials that use the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) or Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) as endpoints, we developed statistical equivalences between changes in these measures and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses. For superiority trials, we computed the minimal detectable difference in DAS28 changes and SDAI changes that correspond to the ACR criteria for 20% improvement (ACR20) and 50% improvement (ACR50) responses at the same type I and type II errors and same sample size. For noninferiority trials, we computed noninferiority margins that were statistically equivalent across measures. Standard deviations of the changes in the DAS28 and SDAI from a recent observational study were used as the basis of calculations in our examples. In the base scenario with type 1 error 0.05 and power 0.80, a trial with 300 subjects per arm would detect a 0.31-point difference in mean DAS28 change scores and 3.71-point difference in mean SDAI change scores as statistically equivalent to an absolute difference of 11% in ACR20 between treatment arms. We developed a web-based utility that provides equivalent differences among these measures for customized sample sizes, error rates, and standard deviations of the DAS28 and SDAI between-arm differences. The DAS28 and SDAI responses can be related to statistically equivalent changes in ACR responses, which can aid the interpretation of trials that use these measures.","author":[{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M"}],"citation-key":"Dasgupta:2019","container-title":"Arthritis Care & Research","DOI":"10.1002/acr.23825","ISSN":"2151-4658","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"page":"1482–1487","PMID":"30629334","title":"Translating treatment effects between rheumatoid arthritis activity measures and ACR responses in direct comparison trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/acr.23825","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"Dasgupta2014","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Logistic regression has been the de facto, and often the only, model used in the description and analysis of relationships between a binary outcome and observed features. It is widely used to obtain the conditional probabilities of the outcome given predictors, as well as predictor effect size estimates using conditional odds ratios. RESULTS: We show how statistical learning machines for binary outcomes, provably consistent for the nonparametric regression problem, can be used to provide both consistent conditional probability estimation and conditional effect size estimates. Effect size estimates from learning machines leverage our understanding of counterfactual arguments central to the interpretation of such estimates. We show that, if the data generating model is logistic, we can recover accurate probability predictions and effect size estimates with nearly the same efficiency as a correct logistic model, both for main effects and interactions. We also propose a method using learning machines to scan for possible interaction effects quickly and efficiently. Simulations using random forest probability machines are presented. CONCLUSIONS: The models we propose make no assumptions about the data structure, and capture the patterns in the data by just specifying the predictors involved and not any particular model structure. So they do not run the same risks of model mis-specification and the resultant estimation biases as a logistic model. This methodology, which we call a \"risk machine\", will share properties from the statistical machine that it is derived from.","author":[{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Szymczak","given":"Silke"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Jason H"},{"family":"Bailey-Wilson","given":"Joan E"},{"family":"Malley","given":"James D"}],"citation-key":"Dasgupta2014","container-title":"BioData Mining","container-title-short":"BioData Mining","event-place":"England","ISSN":"1756-0381 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"2","PMID":"24581306","publisher-place":"England","title":"Risk estimation using probability machines.","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Although a variety of machine learning methods have been introduced for tackling time-to-event prediction in unstructured data with complex dependencies, clustering of survival data remains an under-explored problem. The latter is particularly helpful in discovering patient subpopulations whose survival is regulated by different generative mechanisms, a critical problem in precision medicine. To this end, we introduce a novel probabilistic approach to cluster survival data in a variational deep clustering setting. Our proposed method employs a deep generative model to uncover the underlying distribution of both the explanatory variables and the potentially censored survival times. We compare our model to the related work on survival clustering in comprehensive experiments on a range of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets. Our proposed method performs better at identifying clusters and is competitive at predicting survival times in terms of the concordance index and relative absolute error.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Davidson-Pilon","given":"Cameron"},{"family":"Kalderstam","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Jacobson","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Zivich","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Mike"},{"family":"AbdealiJK","given":""},{"family":"Deepyaman Datta","given":""},{"family":"Fiore-Gartland","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Parij","given":"Alex"},{"family":"WIlson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gabriel","given":""},{"family":"Moneda","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Moncada-Torres","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Stark","given":"Kyle"},{"family":"Gadgil","given":"Harsh"},{"family":"Jona","given":""},{"family":"Karthikeyan Singaravelan","given":""},{"family":"Besson","given":"Lilian"},{"family":"Peña","given":"Miguel Sancho"},{"family":"Anton","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Klintberg","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"GrowthJeff","given":""},{"family":"Noorbakhsh","given":"Javad"},{"family":"Begun","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Ravin Kumar","given":""},{"family":"Hussey","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Skipper Seabold","given":""},{"family":"Golland","given":"Dave"}],"citation-key":"davidson-pilonCamDavidsonPilonLifelinesV02021","DOI":"10.5281/ZENODO.4505728","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,5]]},"license":"Open Access","publisher":"Zenodo","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines: v0.25.9","title-short":"CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines","type":"software","URL":"https://zenodo.org/record/4505728","version":"v0.25.9"},

Statistical approaches addressing these problems are hampered by population heterogeneity and challenges inherent in data integration across high-dimensional, diverse covariates. We have developed a survival-supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (survLDA) modeling framework to address these concerns. LDA models have proven extremely effective at identifying themes common across large collections of text, but applications to genomics have been limited. Our framework extends LDA to the genome by considering each patient as a `document' with `text' constructed from clinical and high-dimensional genomic measurements. We then further extend the framework to allow for supervision by a time-to-event response. The model enables the efficient identification of collections of clinical and genomic features that co-occur within patient subgroups, and then characterizes each patient by those features. An application of survLDA to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian project identifies informative patient subgroups that are characterized by different propensities for exhibiting abnormal mRNA expression and methylations, corresponding to differential rates of survival from primary therapy.","author":[{"family":"Dawson","given":"John A"},{"family":"Kendziorski","given":"Christina"}],"citation-key":"Dawson2012","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Library","title":"Survival-supervised latent Dirichlet allocation models for genomic analysis of time-to-event outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5999","volume":"stat.ME"},
  {"id":"daySurveyHeterogeneousTransfer2017","abstract":"Transfer learning has been demonstrated to be effective for many real-world applications as it exploits knowledge present in labeled training data from a source domain to enhance a model’s performance in a target domain, which has little or no labeled target training data. Utilizing a labeled source, or auxiliary, domain for aiding a target task can greatly reduce the cost and effort of collecting sufficient training labels to create an effective model in the new target distribution. Currently, most transfer learning methods assume the source and target domains consist of the same feature spaces which greatly limits their applications. This is because it may be difficult to collect auxiliary labeled source domain data that shares the same feature space as the target domain. Recently, heterogeneous transfer learning methods have been developed to address such limitations. This, in effect, expands the application of transfer learning to many other real-world tasks such as cross-language text categorization, text-to-image classification, and many others. Heterogeneous transfer learning is characterized by the source and target domains having differing feature spaces, but may also be combined with other issues such as differing data distributions and label spaces.

  {"id":"debezieuxImprovingReplicabilitySinglecell2020","abstract":"Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has allowed many new types of investigations at unprecedented and unique levels of resolution. Among the primary goals of scRNA-Seq is the classification of cells into potentially novel cell types. Many approaches build on the existing clustering literature to develop tools specific to single-cell applications. However, almost all of these methods rely on heuristics or user-supplied parameters to control the number of clusters identified. This affects both the resolution of the clusters within the original dataset as well as their replicability across datasets. While many recommendations exist to select these tuning parameters, most of them are quite ad hoc. In general, there is little assurance that any given set of parameters will represent an optimal choice in the ever-present trade-off between cluster resolution and replicability. For instance, it may be the case that another set of parameters will result in more clusters that are also more replicable, or in fewer clusters that are also less replicable. Here, we propose a new method called Dune for optimizing the trade-off between the resolution of the clusters and their replicability across datasets. Our method takes as input a set of clustering results on a single dataset, derived from any set of clustering algorithms and associated tuning parameters, and iteratively merges clusters within partitions in order to maximize their concordance between partitions. As demonstrated on a variety of scRNA-Seq datasets from different platforms, Dune outperforms existing techniques, that rely on hierarchical merging for reducing the number of clusters, in terms of replicability of the resultant merged clusters. It provides an objective approach for identifying replicable consensus clusters most likely to represent common biological features across multiple datasets.","author":[{"family":"Bézieux","given":"Hector Roux","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"literal":"Kelly Street"},{"family":"Street","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Stephan"},{"literal":"Koen Van den Berge"},{"family":"Van den Berge","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Chance","given":"Rebecca K."},{"literal":"Rebecca K Chance"},{"family":"Risso","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Gillis","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Ngai","given":"John"},{"family":"Purdom","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Dudoit","given":"Sandrine"}],"citation-key":"debezieuxImprovingReplicabilitySinglecell2020","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.03.03.974220","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,4]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3009968321","title":"Improving replicability in single-cell RNA-Seq cell type discovery with Dune","type":"article-journal"},

When multiple validations have been performed, a systematic review followed by a formal meta-analysis helps to summarize overall performance across multiple settings, and reveals under which circumstances the model performs suboptimal (alternative poorer) and may need adjustment. We discuss how to undertake meta-analysis of the performance of prediction models with either a binary or a time-to-event outcome. We address how to deal with incomplete availability of study-specific results (performance estimates and their precision), and how to produce summary estimates of the c-statistic, the observed:expected ratio and the calibration slope. Furthermore, we discuss the implementation of frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods, and propose novel empirically-based prior distributions to improve estimation of between-study heterogeneity in small samples. Finally, we illustrate all methods using two examples: meta-analysis of the predictive performance of EuroSCORE II and of the Framingham Risk Score.

Motivated by the recent availability of linked electronic health records, we develop a nonparametric Bayesian model for survival analysis with competing risks, which can be used for jointly assessing a patient's risk of multiple (competing) adverse outcomes. The model views a patient's survival times with respect to the competing risks as the outputs of a deep multi-task Gaussian process (DMGP), the inputs to which are the patients' covariates. Unlike parametric survival analysis methods based on Cox and Weibull models, our model uses DMGPs to capture complex non-linear interactions between the patients' covariates and cause-specific survival times, thereby learning flexible patient-specific and cause-specific survival curves, all in a data-driven fashion without explicit parametric assumptions on the hazard rates. We propose a variational inference algorithm that is capable of learning the model parameters from time-to-event data while handling right censoring.

  {"id":"deglasPerformingSurvivalAnalyses2016","abstract":"An important consideration in studies that use cause-specific endpoints such as cancer-specific survival or disease recurrence is that risk of dying from another cause before experiencing the event of interest is generally much higher in older patients. Such competing events are of major importance in the design and analysis of studies with older patients, as a patient who dies from another cause before the event of interest cannot reach the endpoint. In this Commentary, we present several clinical examples of research questions in a population-based cohort of older breast cancer patients with a high frequency of competing events and discuss implications of choosing models that deal with competing risks in different ways. We show that in populations with high frequency of competing events, it is important to consider which method is most appropriate to estimate cause-specific endpoints. We demonstrate that when calculating absolute cause-specific risks the Kaplan-Meier method overestimates risk of the event of interest and that the cumulative incidence competing risks (CICR) method, which takes competing risks into account, should be used instead. Two approaches are commonly used to model the association between prognostic factors and cause-specific survival: the Cox proportional hazards model and the Fine and Gray model. We discuss both models and show that in etiologic research the Cox Proportional Hazards model is recommended, while in predictive research the Fine and Gray model is often more appropriate. In conclusion, in studies with cause-specific endpoints in populations with a high frequency of competing events, researchers should carefully choose the most appropriate statistical method to prevent incorrect interpretation of results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Glas","given":"Nienke A.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Kiderlen","given":"Mandy"},{"family":"Vandenbroucke","given":"Jan P."},{"family":"Craen","given":"Anton J.

Evidence for assignment is based on a classification tree of previously available scRNA-seq reference data and includes a confidence score based on the variance in gene expression per cell type. For cell types represented in the reference data, CHETAH’s accuracy is as good as existing methods. Its specificity is superior when cells of an unknown type are encountered, such as malignant cells in tumor samples which it pinpoints as intermediate or unassigned. Although designed for tumor samples in particular, the use of unassigned and intermediate types is also valuable in other exploratory studies. This is exemplified in pancreas datasets where CHETAH highlights cell populations not well represented in the reference dataset, including cells with profiles that lie on a continuum between that of acinar and ductal cell types. Having the possibility of unassigned and intermediate cell types is pivotal for preventing misclassification and can yield important biological information for previously unexplored tissues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"de Kanter","given":"Jurrian K"},{"family":"Lijnzaad","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Candelli","given":"Tito"},{"family":"Margaritis","given":"Thanasis"},{"family":"Holstege","given":"Frank C P"}],"citation-key":"dekanterCHETAHSelectiveHierarchical2019","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkz543","ISSN":"0305-1048, 1362-4962","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e95-e95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"CHETAH: a selective, hierarchical cell type identification method for single-cell RNA sequencing","title-short":"CHETAH","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/16/e95/5521789","volume":"47"},

Previous work on sample size requirements for estimating the prevalence of disease in the case of a single imperfect test showed very large discrepancies in size when compared to methods that assume a perfect test. In this article we extend these methods to include two conditionally independent imperfect tests, and apply several different criteria for Bayesian sample size determination to the design of such studies. We consider both disease prevalence studies and studies designed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. As the problem is typically nonidentifiable, we investigate the limits on the accuracy of parameter estimation as the sample size approaches infinity. Through two examples from infectious diseases, we illustrate the changes in sample sizes that arise when two tests are applied to individuals in a study rather than a single test.

  {"id":"dendukuri_2010","abstract":"Abstract\n            Diagnostic tests rarely provide perfect results. The misclassification induced by imperfect sensitivities and specificities of diagnostic tests must be accounted for when planning prevalence studies or investigations into properties of new tests. The previous work has shown that applying a single imperfect test to estimate prevalence can often result in very large sample size requirements, and that sometimes even an infinite sample size is insufficient for precise estimation because the problem is non‐identifiable. Adding a second test can sometimes reduce the sample size substantially, but infinite sample sizes can still occur as the problem remains non‐identifiable. We investigate the further improvement possible when three diagnostic tests are to be applied. We first develop methods required for studies when three conditionally independent tests are available, using different Bayesian criteria. We then apply these criteria to prototypic scenarios, showing that large sample size reductions can occur compared to when only one or two tests are used. As the problem is now identifiable, infinite sample sizes cannot occur except in pathological situations. Finally, we relax the conditional independence assumption, demonstrating in this once again non‐identifiable situation that sample sizes may substantially grow and possibly be infinite. We apply our methods to the planning of two infectious disease studies, the first designed to estimate the prevalence of Strongyloides infection, and the second relating to estimating the sensitivity of a new test for tuberculosis transmission. The much smaller sample sizes that are typically required when three as compared to one or two tests are used should encourage researchers to plan their studies using more than two diagnostic tests whenever possible. User‐friendly software is available for both design and analysis stages greatly facilitating the use of these methods.

  {"id":"densonStudentChoicesUsing1996","abstract":"By using a competing risks model, survival analysis methods can be extended to predict which of several mutually exclusive outcomes students will choose based on predictor variables, thereby ascertaining if the profile of risk differs across groups. The paper begins with a brief introduction to logistic regression and some of the basic concepts of survival analysis necessary to understand the competing risks survival analysis method. A data set is used to illustrate conducting the competing risks survival analysis, and results of that analysis for each competing risk and predictor variable are presented and interpreted. The procedure for conducting a competing risks survival analysis is similar to that of conducting a survival analysis with only one outcome. Data are prepared and  coded in a like manner, and survival and hazard functions are interpreted by the same guidelines. However, in a competing risks survival analysis, the hazard probabilities for each competing outcome are recombined to create a complete profile of each risk for each time period in question. Data from the Dallas (Texas) public schools for 7,748 students (ninth graders in 1990-91) with no more than one of the defined competing risks (school leaving or completion) illustrate the analysis approach.

Highest Posterior Density (HPD) sets are often used because they guarantee the shortest length. In most of standard problems, closed-form expressions for exact HPD intervals do not exist, but they are available for intervals based on the normal approximation of the posterior distribution. For small sample sizes, approximate intervals may be not calibrated in terms of posterior probability, but for increasing sample sizes their posterior probability tends to the correct credible level and they become closer and closer to exact sets. The article proposes a predictive analysis to select appropriate sample sizes needed to have approximate intervals calibrated at a pre-specified level. Examples are given for interval estimation of proportions and log-odds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"De Santis","given":"Fulvio"},{"family":"Gubbiotti","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"desantisSampleSizeRequirements2021","container-title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","DOI":"10.3390/ijerph18020595","ISSN":"1660-4601","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"595","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Sample Size Requirements for Calibrated Approximate Credible Intervals for Proportions in Clinical Trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/2/595","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"devauxIndividualDynamicPrediction2021","abstract":"The individual data collected throughout patient follow-up constitute crucial information for assessing the risk of a clinical event, and eventually for adapting a therapeutic strategy. Joint models and landmark models have been proposed to compute individual dynamic predictions from repeated measures to one or two markers. However, they hardly extend to the case where the complete patient history includes much more repeated markers possibly. Our objective was thus to propose a solution for the dynamic prediction of a health event that may exploit repeated measures of a possibly large number of markers. We combined a landmark approach extended to endogenous markers history with machine learning methods adapted to survival data. Each marker trajectory is modeled using the information collected up to landmark time, and summary variables that best capture the individual trajectories are derived. These summaries and additional covariates are then included in different prediction methods. To handle a possibly large dimensional history, we rely on machine learning methods adapted to survival data, namely regularized regressions and random survival forests, to predict the event from the landmark time, and we show how they can be combined into a superlearner. Then, the performances are evaluated by cross-validation using estimators of Brier Score and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve adapted to censored data. We demonstrate in a simulation study the benefits of machine learning survival methods over standard survival models, especially in the case of numerous and/or nonlinear relationships between the predictors and the event. We then applied the methodology in two prediction contexts: a clinical context with the prediction of death for patients with primary biliary cholangitis, and a public health context with the prediction of death in the general elderly population at different ages. Our methodology, implemented in R, enables the prediction of an event using the entire longitudinal patient history, even when the number of repeated markers is large. Although introduced with mixed models for the repeated markers and methods for a single right censored time-to-event, our method can be used with any other appropriate modeling technique for the markers and can be easily extended to competing risks setting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Devaux","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Genuer","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Pérès","given":"Karine"},{"family":"Proust-Lima","given":"Cécile"}],"citation-key":"devauxIndividualDynamicPrediction2021","container-title":"arXiv:2102.01466 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,2]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Individual dynamic prediction of clinical endpoint from large dimensional longitudinal biomarker history: a landmark approach","title-short":"Individual dynamic prediction of clinical endpoint from large dimensional longitudinal biomarker history","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01466"},

  {"id":"diaz-mejiaEvaluationMethodsAssign2019","abstract":"Background: Identification of cell type subpopulations from complex cell mixtures using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data includes automated steps from normalization to cell clustering. However, assigning cell type labels to cell clusters is often conducted manually, resulting in limited documentation, low reproducibility and uncontrolled vocabularies. This is partially due to the scarcity of reference cell type signatures and because some methods support limited cell type signatures., \nMethods: In this study, we benchmarked five methods representing first-generation enrichment analysis (ORA), second-generation approaches (GSEA and GSVA), machine learning tools (CIBERSORT) and network-based neighbor voting (METANEIGHBOR), for the task of assigning cell type labels to cell clusters from scRNA-seq data. We used five scRNA-seq datasets: human liver, 11 Tabula Muris mouse tissues, two human peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets, and mouse retinal neurons, for which reference cell type signatures were available. The datasets span Drop-seq, 10X Chromium and Seq-Well technologies and range in size from ~3,700 to ~68,000 cells., \nResults: Our results show that, in general, all five methods perform well in the task as evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91, sd = 0.06), whereas precision-recall analyses show a wide variation depending on the method and dataset (average AUC = 0.53, sd = 0.24). We observed an influence of the number of genes in cell type signatures on performance, with smaller signatures leading more frequently to incorrect results., \nConclusions: GSVA was the overall top performer and was more robust in cell type signature subsampling simulations, although different methods performed well using different datasets. METANEIGHBOR and GSVA were the fastest methods. CIBERSORT and METANEIGHBOR were more influenced than the other methods by analyses including only expected cell types.

  {"id":"dignamUseInterpretationCompeting2012","abstract":"PURPOSE Competing risks observations, in which patients are subject to a number of potential failure events, are a feature of most clinical cancer studies. With competing risks, several modeling approaches are available to evaluate the relationship of covariates to cause-specific failures. We discuss the use and interpretation of commonly used competing risks regression models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN For competing risks analysis, the influence of covariate can be evaluated in relation to cause-specific hazard or on the cumulative incidence of the failure types. We present simulation studies to illustrate how covariate effects differ between these approaches. We then show the implications of model choice in an example from a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) clinical trial for prostate cancer. RESULTS The simulation studies illustrate that, depending on the relationship of a covariate to both the failure type of principal interest and the competing failure type, different models can result in substantially different effects. For example, a covariate that has no direct influence on the hazard of a primary event can still be significantly associated with the cumulative probability of that event, if the covariate influences the hazard of a competing event. This is a logical consequence of a fundamental difference between the model formulations. The example from RTOG similarly shows differences in the influence of age and tumor grade depending on the endpoint and the model type used. CONCLUSIONS Competing risks regression modeling requires that one considers the specific question of interest and subsequent choice of the best model to address it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Dignam","given":"James J"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Kocherginsky","given":"Masha"}],"citation-key":"dignamUseInterpretationCompeting2012","container-title":"Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2097","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,15]]},"number":"8","page":"2301-8","PMID":"22282466","publisher":"NIH Public Access","title":"The use and interpretation of competing risks regression models.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22282466","volume":"18"},

UroVysion is a multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay that detects common chromosome abnormalities in bladder cancers. For this study, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of multiprobe FISH and urine cytology in detecting urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) in the same urine sample.\n            \n            \n              METHODS\n              In total, 1835 cases with the following criteria were selected: valid results from both the multiprobe FISH assay and urine cytology in the same urine sample, histologic and/or cystoscopic follow‐up within 4 months of the original tests, or at least 3 years of clinical follow‐up information. The results of FISH and cytology were correlated with clinical outcomes derived from a combination of histologic, cystoscopic, and clinical follow‐up information.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Of 1835 cases, 1045 cases were from patients undergoing surveillance of recurrent UCC, and 790 were for hematuria. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in detecting UCC were 61.9%, 89.7%, 53.9%, and 92.4%, respectively, for FISH and 29.1%, 96.9%, 64.4%, and 87.5%, respectively, for cytology. The performance of both FISH and cytology generally was better in the surveillance population and in samples with high‐grade UCC. In 95 of 296 cases with atypical cytology that were proven to have UCC, 61 cases, mostly high‐grade UCC, were positive using the multiprobe FISH assay.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS\n              The UroVysion multiprobe FISH assay was more sensitive than urine cytology in detecting UCC, but it produced more false‐positive results. The current data suggest that the use of FISH as a reflex test after an equivocal cytologic diagnosis may play an effective role in detecting UCC.

  {"id":"dingBayesianIndirectMixed2013","abstract":"Meta-analysis has become an acceptable and powerful tool for pooling quantitative results from multiple studies addressing the same question. It estimates the effect difference between two treatments when they have been compared head-to-head. However, limitations occur when there are more than two treatments of interest, and some of them have not been compared in the same study. Indirect and mixed treatment modeling extends meta-analysis methods to enable data from different treatments and trials to be synthesized, without requiring head-to-head comparisons among all treatments; thus, allowing different treatments to be compared. Traditional indirect and mixed treatment comparison methods consider a single endpoint for each trial. We extend the current methods and propose a Bayesian indirect and mixed treatment comparison longitudinal model that incorporates multiple time points and allows indirect comparisons of treatment effects across different longitudinal studies. The proposed model only uses summary level longitudinal data. This model is particularly useful when a meta-analysis is performed on studies with different durations. It enables the borrowing of information from shorter studies even in the situation where the primary interest is in a time point beyond the duration of some of these shorter studies. We performed simulation studies, which demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and yields better estimations compared with other single time point meta-analysis methods. We apply our method to a set of studies from patients with type 2 diabetes.","author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Haoda"}],"citation-key":"dingBayesianIndirectMixed2013","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.5688","ISBN":"0277-6715","ISSN":"02776715","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"number":"15","PMID":"23229717","title":"Bayesian indirect and mixed treatment comparisons across longitudinal time points","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

Dimensionality reduction is a crucial step in interpreting the relation between cells in scRNA-seq data. However, current dimensionality reduction methods are often confounded by multiple simultaneous technical and biological variability, result in “crowding” of cells in the center of the latent space, or inadequately capture temporal relationships. Here, we introduce scPhere, a scalable deep generative model to embed cells into low-dimensional hyperspherical or hyperbolic spaces to accurately represent scRNA-seq data. ScPhere addresses multi-level, complex batch factors, facilitates the interactive visualization of large datasets, resolves cell crowding, and uncovers temporal trajectories. We demonstrate scPhere on nine large datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development. Our results show how scPhere facilitates the interpretation of scRNA-seq data by generating batch-invariant embeddings to map data from new individuals, identifies cell types affected by biological variables, infers cells’ spatial positions in pre-defined biological specimens, and highlights complex cellular relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Jiarui"},{"family":"Regev","given":"Aviv"}],"citation-key":"dingDeepGenerativeModel2021","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22851-4","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,5]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"2554","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Deep generative model embedding of single-cell RNA-Seq profiles on hyperspheres and hyperbolic spaces","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22851-4","volume":"12"},

However, dimension reduction to interpret structure in single-cell sequencing data remains a challenge. Existing algorithms are either not able to uncover the clustering structures in the data or lose global information such as groups of clusters that are close to each other. We present a robust statistical model, scvis, to capture and visualize the low-dimensional structures in single-cell gene expression data. Simulation results demonstrate that low-dimensional representations learned by scvis preserve both the local and global neighbor structures in the data. In addition, scvis is robust to the number of data points and learns a probabilistic parametric mapping function to add new data points to an existing embedding. We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ding","given":"Jiarui"},{"family":"Condon","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Sohrab P."}],"citation-key":"dingInterpretableDimensionalityReduction2018","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-018-04368-5","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5,21]]},"language":"en","page":"2002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interpretable dimensionality reduction of single cell transcriptome data with deep generative models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04368-5","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Dittman2011","abstract":"The goal of classification is to reliably identify instances that are members of the class of interest. This is especially important for predicting patient response to drugs. However, with high dimensional datasets, classification is both complicated and enhanced by the feature selection process. When designing a classification experiment there are a number of decisions which need to be made in order to maximize performance. These decisions are especially difficult for researchers in fields where data mining is not the focus, such as patient response prediction. It would be easier for such researchers to make these decisions if either their outcomes were chosen or their scope reduced, by using a learner which minimizes the impact of these decisions. We propose that Random Forest, a popular ensemble learner, can serve this role. We performed an experiment involving nineteen different feature selection rankers (eleven of which were proposed and implemented by our research team) to thoroughly test both the Random Forest learner and five other learners. Our research shows that, as long as a large enough number of features are used, the results of using Random Forest are favorable regardless of the choice of feature selection strategy, showing that Random Forest is a suitable choice for patient response prediction researchers who want to do not wish to choose from amongst a myriad of feature selection approaches.","author":[{"family":"Dittman","given":"D"},{"family":"Khoshgoftaar","given":"T M"},{"family":"Wald","given":"R"},{"family":"Napolitano","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Dittman2011","container-title":"Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops (BIBMW), 2011 IEEE International Conference on","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"289-296","title":"Random forest: A reliable tool for patient response prediction","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/freesrchabstract.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112389"},

Determining the number of samples required to train a predictor from survival data is important for designing such studies. Existing sample size methods for training studies use parametric models for the high-dimensional data and cannot handle a right-censored dependent variable. We present a new training sample size method that is non-parametric with respect to the high-dimensional vectors, and is developed for a right-censored response. The method can be applied to any prediction algorithm that satisfies a set of conditions. The sample size is chosen so that the expected performance of the predictor is within a user-defined tolerance of optimal. The central method is based on a pilot dataset. To quantify uncertainty, a method to construct a confidence interval for the tolerance is developed. Adequacy of the size of the pilot dataset is discussed. An alternative model-based version of our method for estimating the tolerance when no adequate pilot dataset is available is presented. The model-based method requires a covariance matrix be specified, but we show that the identity covariance matrix provides adequate sample size when the user specifies three key quantities.

Currently, while a subset of patients experience substantial clinical benefit in response to different immunotherapeutic approaches, the majority of patients do not but are still exposed to the significant drug toxicities. Therefore, a growing need for the development and clinical use of predictive biomarkers exists in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Predictive cancer biomarkers can be used to identify the patients who are or who are not likely to derive benefit from specific therapeutic approaches. In order to be applicable in a clinical setting, predictive biomarkers must be carefully shepherded through a step-wise, highly regulated developmental process. Volume I of this two-volume document focused on the pre-analytical and analytical phases of the biomarker development process, by providing background, examples and “good practice” recommendations. In the current Volume II, the focus is on the clinical validation, validation of clinical utility and regulatory considerations for biomarker development. Together, this two volume series is meant to provide guidance on the entire biomarker development process, with a particular focus on the unique aspects of developing immune-based biomarkers. Specifically, knowledge about the challenges to clinical validation of predictive biomarkers, which has been gained from numerous successes and failures in other contexts, will be reviewed together with statistical methodological issues related to bias and overfitting. The different trial designs used for the clinical validation of biomarkers will also be discussed, as the selection of clinical metrics and endpoints becomes critical to establish the clinical utility of the biomarker during the clinical validation phase of the biomarker development. Finally, the regulatory aspects of submission of biomarker assays to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as regulatory considerations in the European Union will be covered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Dobbin","given":"Kevin K."},{"family":"Cesano","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"John"},{"family":"Hawtin","given":"Rachael"},{"family":"Janetzki","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Kirsch","given":"Ilan"},{"family":"Masucci","given":"Giuseppe V."},{"family":"Robbins","given":"Paul B."},{"family":"Selvan","given":"Senthamil R."},{"family":"Streicher","given":"Howard Z."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jenny"},{"family":"Butterfield","given":"Lisa H."},{"family":"Thurin","given":"Magdalena"}],"citation-key":"dobbinValidationBiomarkersPredict2016","container-title":"Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1186/s40425-016-0179-0","ISSN":"2051-1426","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11,15]]},"page":"77","PMCID":"PMC5109653","PMID":"27891226","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Validation of biomarkers to predict response to immunotherapy in cancer: Volume II — clinical validation and regulatory considerations","title-short":"Validation of biomarkers to predict response to immunotherapy in cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5109653/","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"doldJointBayesianInference2014","abstract":"Statistical modeling produces compressed and often more easily interpretable descriptions of experimental data in form of model parameters. When experimental manipulations target selected parameters, it is necessary for their interpretation that other model components remain constant. For example, psychophysicists use dose rate models to describe how behavior changes as a function of a single stimulus variable. The main interest is on shifts of this function induced by experimental manipulation, assuming invariance in other aspects of the function. Combining several experimental conditions in a joint analysis that takes such invariance constraints into account can result in a complex model for which no robust standard procedures are available. We formulate a solution for the joint analysis through repeated applications of standard procedures by allowing an additional assumption. This way, experimental conditions can be analyzed separately such that all conditions are implicitly taken into account. We investigate the validity of the supplementary assumption through simulations. Furthermore, we present a natural way to check whether a joint treatment is appropriate. We illustrate the method for the specific case of the psychometric function; however the procedure applies to other models that encompass multiple experimental conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dold","given":"Hannah M.

  {"id":"dongCellTypeIdentification2020","abstract":"Cell type identification from single-cell transcriptomic data is a common goal of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data analysis. Neural networks have been employed to identify cell types from scRNAseq data with high performance. However, it requires a large mount of individual cells with accurate and unbiased annotated types to build the identification models. Unfortunately, labeling the scRNAseq data is cumbersome and time-consuming as it involves manual inspection of marker genes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a semi-supervised learning model to use unlabeled scRNAseq cells and limited amount of labeled scRNAseq cells to implement cell identification. Firstly, we transform the scRNAseq cells to \"gene sentences\", which is inspired by similarities between natural language system and gene system. Then genes in these sentences are represented as gene embeddings to reduce data sparsity. With these embeddings, we implement a semi-supervised learning model based on recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNN), which includes a shared network, a supervised network and an unsupervised network. The proposed model is evaluated on macosko2015, a large scale single-cell transcriptomic dataset with ground truth of individual cell types. It is observed that the proposed model is able to achieve encouraging performance by learning on very limited amount of labeled scRNAseq cells together with a large number of unlabeled scRNAseq cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Xishuang"},{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"Shanta"},{"family":"Victor","given":"Uboho"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiangfang"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Lijun"}],"citation-key":"dongCellTypeIdentification2020","container-title":"arXiv:2005.03994 [cs, q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Cell Type Identification from Single-Cell Transcriptomic Data via Semi-supervised Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03994","version":"1"},

  {"id":"donnoPopulationlevelIntegrationSinglecell2022","abstract":"The increasing generation of population-level single-cell atlases with hundreds or thousands of samples has the potential to link demographic and technical metadata with high-resolution cellular and tissue data in homeostasis and disease. Constructing such comprehensive references requires large-scale integration of heterogeneous cohorts with varying metadata capturing demographic and technical information. Here, we present single-cell population level integration (scPoli), a semi-supervised conditional deep generative model for data integration, label transfer and query-to-reference mapping. Unlike other models, scPoli learns both sample and cell representations, is aware of cell-type annotations and can integrate and annotate newly generated query datasets while providing an uncertainty mechanism to identify unknown populations. We extensively evaluated the method and showed its advantages over existing approaches. We applied scPoli to two population-level atlases of lung and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the latter consisting of roughly 8 million cells across 2,375 samples. We demonstrate that scPoli allows atlas-level integration and automatic reference mapping with label transfer. It can explain sample-level biological and technical variations such as disease, anatomical location and assay by means of its novel sample embeddings. We use these embeddings to explore sample-level metadata, enable automatic sample classification and guide a data integration workflow. scPoli also enables simultaneous sample-level and cell-level analysis of gene expression patterns, revealing genes associated with batch effects and the main axes of between-sample variation. We envision scPoli becoming an important tool for population-level single-cell data integration facilitating atlas use but also interpretation by means of multi-scale analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Donno","given":"Carlo De"},{"family":"Hediyeh-Zadeh","given":"Soroor"},{"family":"Wagenstetter","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Moinfar","given":"Amir Ali"},{"family":"Zappia","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Lotfollahi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Theis","given":"Fabian J."}],"citation-key":"donnoPopulationlevelIntegrationSinglecell2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.11.28.517803","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In “The Future of Data Analysis,” he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or “data analysis.” Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name “data science” for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of “data science” programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a $100M “Data Science Initiative” that aims to hire 35 new faculty....","author":[{"family":"Donoho","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"donoho50YearsData2017","container-title":"Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","DOI":"10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734","ISBN":"0672326965","ISSN":"15372715","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"number":"4","page":"745-766","PMID":"25246403","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","title":"50 Years of Data Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734","volume":"26"},
  {"id":"dorie_2022","abstract":"A wide range of machine-learning-based approaches have been developed in the past decade, increasing our ability to accurately model nonlinear and nonadditive response surfaces. This has improved performance for inferential tasks such as estimating average treatment effects in situations where standard parametric models may not fit the data well. These methods have also shown promise for the related task of identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. However, the estimation of both overall and heterogeneous treatment effects can be hampered when data are structured within groups if we fail to correctly model the dependence between observations. Most machine learning methods do not readily accommodate such structure. This paper introduces a new algorithm, stan4bart, that combines the flexibility of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for fitting nonlinear response surfaces with the computational and statistical efficiencies of using Stan for the parametric components of the model. We demonstrate how stan4bart can be used to estimate average, subgroup, and individual-level treatment effects with stronger performance than other flexible approaches that ignore the multilevel structure of the data as well as multilevel approaches that have strict parametric forms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Dorie","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Perrett","given":"George"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Goodrich","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"dorie_2022","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e24121782","ISSN":"1099-4300","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"1782","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Stan and BART for Causal Inference: Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Using the Power of Stan and the Flexibility of Machine Learning","title-short":"Stan and BART for Causal Inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/12/1782","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"dou:2024","abstract":"During the period of 2011–2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) granted 139 accelerated and 329 regular approvals for 86 and 152 cancer therapeutic products, respectively. The percentage of approvals for a biomarker‐defined population was numerically higher in accelerated approvals in comparison to regular approvals, that is, 48% vs. 40%. From 2011–2016 to 2017–2023, there was an increasing number of approvals with biomarker‐defined populations in lung and breast cancers, serving as the primary driver for the overall increase in the percentage of approvals for biomarker‐defined populations in solid tumors relative to hematological malignancies. Over the years, approvals were incorporating a more diverse collection of distinct biomarkers, from 3 in 2011 to 16 in 2022. Overall, HER2, hormone receptor (HR), EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and PD‐L1‐defined populations received the highest numbers of approvals. The FDA decision on approving a biomarker‐defined or an all‐comers population may depend on a number of factors and may evolve over time based on emerging evidence. The review discusses selected FDA approvals where a pivotal trial enrolled an all‐comers population but the approved indication was restricted to a biomarker‐defined population, as well as challenges in clinical trial design in the context of precision medicine. The prominent role of biomarkers in optimizing trial design and identifying a population most likely to benefit from treatment underlines the significance of a comprehensive understanding of disease biology and drug mechanisms. Our review illustrates that biomarker‐driven approaches enhance the likelihood of identifying optimal patient populations, potentially streamlining trials through accelerated approval pathways for cancer drug development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Dou","given":"Yannan Nancy"},{"family":"Grimstein","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Mascaro","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian"}],"citation-key":"dou:2024","container-title":"Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics","container-title-short":"Clin Pharma and Therapeutics","DOI":"10.1002/cpt.3306","ISSN":"0009-9236, 1532-6535","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"cpt.3306","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Biomarkers for Precision Patient Selection in Cancer Therapy Approvals in the US, from 2011 to 2023","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpt.3306"},

  {"id":"dridiBayesianInferenceBiomarker2017","abstract":"This paper addresses the question of biomarker discovery in proteomics. Given clinical data regarding a list of proteins for a set of individuals, the tackled problem is to extract a short subset of proteins the concentrations of which are an indicator of the biological status (healthy or pathological). In this paper, it is formulated as a specific instance of variable selection. The originality is that the proteins are not investigated one after the other but the best partition between discriminant and non-discriminant proteins is directly sought. In this way, correlations between the proteins are intrinsically taken into account in the decision. The developed strategy is derived in a Bayesian setting, and the decision is optimal in the sense that it minimizes a global mean error. It is finally based on the posterior probabilities of the partitions. The main difficulty is to calculate these probabilities since they are based on the so-called evidence that require marginalization of all the unknown model parameters. Two models are presented that relate the status to the protein concentrations, depending whether the latter are biomarkers or not. The first model accounts for biological variabilities by assuming that the concentrations are Gaussian distributed with a mean and a covariance matrix that depend on the status only for the biomarkers. The second one is an extension that also takes into account the technical variabilities that may significantly impact the observed concentrations. The main contributions of the paper are: (1) a new Bayesian formulation of the biomarker selection problem, (2) the closed-form expression of the posterior probabilities in the noiseless case, and (3) a suitable approximated solution in the noisy case. The methods are numerically assessed and compared to the state-of-the-art methods (t test, LASSO, Battacharyya distance, FOHSIC) on synthetic and real data from proteins quantified in human serum by mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring mode.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dridi","given":"Noura"},{"family":"Giremus","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Giovannelli","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Truntzer","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Hadzagic","given":"Melita"},{"family":"Charrier","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Gerfault","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Ducoroy","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Lacroix","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Grangeat","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Pascal"}],"citation-key":"dridiBayesianInferenceBiomarker2017","container-title":"EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology","container-title-short":"EURASIP Journal on Bioinformatics and Systems Biology","DOI":"10.1186/s13637-017-0062-4","ISSN":"1687-4153","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,14]]},"page":"9","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Bayesian inference for biomarker discovery in proteomics: an analytic solution","title-short":"Bayesian inference for biomarker discovery in proteomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13637-017-0062-4","volume":"2017"},

  {"id":"dusseldorpQualitativeInteractionTrees2014","abstract":"When two alternative treatments (A and B) are available, some subgroup of patients may display a better outcome with treatment A than with B, whereas for another subgroup, the reverse may be true. If this is the case, a qualitative (i.e., disordinal) treatment–subgroup interaction is present. Such interactions imply that some subgroups of patients should be treated differently and are therefore most relevant for personalized medicine. In case of data from randomized clinical trials with many patient characteristics that could interact with treatment in a complex way, a suitable statistical approach to detect qualitative treatment–subgroup interactions is not yet available. As a way out, in the present paper, we propose a new method for this purpose, called QUalitative INteraction Trees (QUINT). QUINT results in a binary tree that subdivides the patients into terminal nodes on the basis of patient characteristics; these nodes are further assigned to one of three classes: a first for which A is better than B, a second for which B is better than A, and an optional third for which type of treatment makes no difference. Results of QUINT on simulated data showed satisfactory performance, with regard to optimization and recovery. Results of an application to real data suggested that, compared with other approaches, QUINT provided a more pronounced picture of the qualitative interactions that are present in the data.

  {"id":"dyrskjot_2023","abstract":"563\nBackground: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) accounts for ~25–30% of all bladder cancer diagnoses. With neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) as standard-of-care, the 5-year survival rate ranges from 40%–60%. Bladder-sparing protocols (BSP) have emerged as a feasible alternative to RC for MIBC treatment, however better tools are needed. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in predicting recurrence in patients who achieved pathological complete response (pCR). Methods: We analyzed a previously described cohort of 68 patients (656 plasma samples; Christensen et al., JCO 2019) with MIBC who received NAC prior to cystectomy. Patients had an updated median follow-up of 58.94 months (range: 7.19-81.77) post-cystectomy. ctDNA was analyzed at baseline (before NAC; N=64), and prior to cystectomy (N=65) using a commercially available assay (Signatera, Natera, Inc.). Additionally, exploratory RNA-Seq was performed on tumors from 59 patients (samples with >5M total counts were utilized). Pathway analysis was used to compare ctDNA-positive and ctDNA-negative patients who failed to achieve pCR. Results: Of the 64 patients with ctDNA results available at baseline, 59.4% (38/64) tested ctDNA-negative, and of these 84.2% (32/38) achieved pCR. Furthermore, 40.6% (26/64) tested ctDNA-positive, and only 34.6% (9/26) achieved pCR. Likewise, prior to cystectomy, 83.9% (52/62) of patients were ctDNA-negative, and 80.7% (42/52) achieved pCR, while none of the ctDNA-positive patients achieved pCR (positive predictive value 100%; negative predictive value 80.8%). Based on both ctDNA timepoints, the probability of ctDNA-negative patients to achieve pCR was significantly higher than ctDNA-positive patients (p<0.0001). Notably, ctDNA-positive patients without pCR demonstrated significantly poorer RFS and OS compared to the ctDNA-negative patients, at both timepoints (Baseline: RFS; HR=8.2, p=0.017, OS; HR=8.4, p=0.015, prior to cystectomy: RFS; HR=5.2, p=0.0078, OS; HR=4.8, p=0.012). Furthermore, ctDNA status at baseline and before cystectomy was a better predictor of RFS compared to pCR (HR=8.5, p<0.0001, HR=14, p<0.0001, respectively). Transcriptomic pathway analysis of patients who did not achieve pCR showed an enrichment of oncogenic pathways, namely EMT and angiogenesis, in tumors from ctDNA positive patients, whereas tumors from ctDNA negative patients showed an enrichment of anti-tumor immune signatures, including IFNα and IFNγ. Conclusions: Absence of ctDNA was significantly associated with pCR both at baseline and prior to cystectomy, identifying patients who may benefit from BSP. Larger cohorts are warranted to test the prognostic value of ctDNA combined with transcriptomic profiling in informing patient selection for avoiding cystectomy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Dyrskjøt","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Laliotis MD, PhD","given":"George"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Iver"},{"family":"Birkenkamp-Demtröder","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Viborg Lindskrog","given":"Sia"},{"family":"Lamy","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"White","given":"Elshaddai"},{"family":"Pajak","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Andreasen","given":"Tine Ginnerup"},{"family":"Dutta","given":"Punashi"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Shruti"},{"family":"Calhoun","given":"Mark"},{"family":"ElNaggar","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Minetta C."},{"family":"Agerbaek","given":"Mads"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Jørgen Bjerggaard"}],"citation-key":"dyrskjot_2023","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2023.41.6_suppl.563","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"6_suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,20]]},"page":"563-563","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"ascopubs.org (Atypon)","title":"Utility of ctDNA in predicting outcome and pathological complete response in patients with bladder cancer as a guide for selective bladder preservation strategies.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2023.41.6_suppl.563","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"eatonDesigningClinicalTrials2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The difference in mean survival time, which quantifies the treatment effect in terms most meaningful to patients and retains its interpretability regardless of the shape of the survival distribution or the proportionality of the treatment effect, is an alternative endpoint that could be used more often as the primary endpoint to design clinical trials. The underuse of this endpoint is due to investigators' lack of familiarity with the test comparing the mean survival times and the lack of tools to facilitate trial design with this endpoint. The aim of this article is to provide investigators with insights and software to design trials with restricted mean survival time as the primary endpoint.\nMETHODS: A closed-form formula for the asymptotic power of the test of restricted mean survival time difference is presented. The effects of design parameters on power were evaluated for the mean survival time test and log-rank test. An R package which calculates the power or the sample size for user-specified parameter values and provides power plots for each design parameter is provided. The R package also calculates the probability that the restricted mean survival time is estimable for user-defined trial designs.\nRESULTS: Under proportional hazards and late differences in survival, the power of the mean survival time test can approach that of the log-rank test if the restriction time is late. Under early differences, the power of the restricted mean survival time test is higher than that of the log-rank test. Duration of accrual and follow-up have little influence on the power of the restricted mean survival time test. The choice of restriction time, on the other hand, has a large impact on power. Because the power depends on the interplay among the design factors, plotting the relationship between each design parameter and power allows the users to select the designs most appropriate for their trial. When modification is necessary to ensure the difference in restricted mean survival time is estimable, the three available modifications all perform adequately in the scenarios studied.\nCONCLUSION: The restricted mean survival time is a survival endpoint that is meaningful to investigators and to patients and at the same time requires less restrictive assumptions. The biggest challenge with this endpoint is selection of the restriction time. We recommend selecting a restriction time that is clinically relevant to the disease and the clinical setting of the trial of interest. The practical considerations and the R package provided in this work are readily available tools that researchers can use to design trials with restricted mean survival time as the primary endpoint.","author":[{"family":"Eaton","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Therneau","given":"Terry"},{"family":"Le-Rademacher","given":"Jennifer"}],"citation-key":"eatonDesigningClinicalTrials2020","container-title":"Clinical Trials (London, England)","container-title-short":"Clin Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774520905563","ISSN":"1740-7753","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"285-294","PMID":"32063031","source":"PubMed","title":"Designing clinical trials with (restricted) mean survival time endpoint: Practical considerations","title-short":"Designing clinical trials with (restricted) mean survival time endpoint","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"ediebahJointModelingLongitudinal2015","abstract":"PURPOSE: In cancer research, outcome measures may co-vary. Treatment and treatment related impairment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) may affect survival. When these effects are analyzed separately, bias may arise. Therefore, we investigated the combined effect of treatment and longitudinally measured HRQoL on survival.\nMETHODS: Patients with anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (n = 288) who were randomized (EORTC 26951) to radiotherapy (RT) alone or RT plus procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy were analyzed. HRQoL [appetite loss (AP)] was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30. We compared survival results from different analysis strategies: Cox model with treatment only [model 1 (M1)] or with treatment and time-dependent AP score [model 2 (M2)] and the joint model combining longitudinal AP score and survival [model 3 (M3)].\nRESULTS: The estimated hazard ratio (HR) for RT plus PCV was 0.76 (95 % CI 0.58-1.00) for M1, 0.72 (0.55-0.96) for M2, and 0.69 (0.52-0.92) for M3. This corresponds to a lower risk of death of 24 % in M1, 28 % in M2, and 31 % in M3, for patients treated with RT plus PCV chemotherapy. AP resulted in an increased risk of death, with estimated HR of 1.06 (1.01-1.12) for M2 and 1.13 (1.03-1.23) for M3: Every 10-point increase of AP resulted in a 13 % increased risk of death in M3 as compared to 6 % in M2.\nCONCLUSION: Part of the survival benefit of treatment with RT plus PCV chemotherapy can be masked by the negative effect that this treatment has on patients' HRQoL. In our study, up to 7 % of the theoretical treatment efficacy was lost when AP was not adjusted through joint modeling.","author":[{"family":"Ediebah","given":"Divine E."},{"family":"Galindo-Garre","given":"Francisca"},{"family":"Uitdehaag","given":"Bernard M.

A Bayesian MCMC procedure is developed for parameter estimation and inference. Our method is insensitive to outlying longitudinal measurements in the presence of nonignorable missing data due to dropout. Moreover, by modeling the variance-covariance matrix of the latent random eﬀects, our model provides a useful framework for handling high-dimensional heterogeneous random eﬀects and testing the homogeneous random eﬀects assumption which is otherwise untestable in commonly used joint models.

  {"id":"Elliott2010","abstract":"Most investigations in the social and health sciences aim to understand the directional or causal relationship between a treatment or risk factor and outcome. Given the multitude of pathways through which the treatment or risk factor may affect the outcome, there is also an interest in decomposing the effect of a treatment of risk factor into \"direct\" and \"mediated\" effects. For example, child's socioeconomic status (risk factor) may have a direct effect on the risk of death (outcome) and an effect that may be mediated through the adulthood socioeconomic status (mediator). Building on the potential outcome framework for causal inference, we develop a Bayesian approach for estimating direct and mediated effects in the context of a dichotomous mediator and dichotomous outcome, which is challenging as many parameters cannot be fully identified. We first define principal strata corresponding to the joint distribution of the observed and counterfactual values of the mediator, and define associate, dissociative, and mediated effects as functions of the differences in the mean outcome under differing treatment assignments within the principal strata. We then develop the likelihood properties and calculate nonparametric bounds of these causal effects assuming randomized treatment assignment. Because likelihood theory is not well developed for nonidentifiable parameters, we consider a Bayesian approach that allows the direct and mediated effects to be expressed in terms of the posterior distribution of the population parameters of interest. This range can be reduced by making further assumptions about the parameters that can be encoded in prior distribution assumptions. We perform sensitivity analyses by using several prior distributions that make weaker assumptions than monotonicity or the exclusion restriction. We consider an application that explores the mediating effects of adult poverty on the relationship between childhood poverty and risk of death.","author":[{"family":"Elliott","given":"Michael R"},{"family":"Raghunathan","given":"Trivellore E"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yun"}],"citation-key":"Elliott2010","container-title":"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)","event-place":"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, 1420 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. mrelliot@umich.edu","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"number":"2","page":"353-372","publisher":"Biometrika Trust","publisher-place":"Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, 1420 Washington Heights, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. mrelliot@umich.edu","title":"Bayesian inference for causal mediation effects using principal stratification with dichotomous mediators and outcomes.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=20101045&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"11"},

Recent studies have combined single-cell atlases of specific human tissues and organs with genes associated with human disease to relate risk variants to likely cells of action. ​​However, it has been challenging to extend these studies to profile multiple tissues and organs across the body, conduct studies at population scale, and integrate cell atlases from multiple organs to yield unified insights.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              Because of the pleiotropy and specificity of disease-associated variants, systematically relating variants to cells and molecular processes requires analysis across multiple tissues and individuals. Prior cell atlases primarily relied on fresh tissue samples from a single organ or tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) can be applied to frozen, archived tissue and captures cell types that do not survive dissociation across many tissues. Deep learning methods can integrate data across individuals and tissues by controlling for batch effects while preserving biological variation.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              We established a framework for multitissue human cell atlases and generated an atlas of 209,126 snRNA-seq profiles from eight tissue types across 16 individuals, archived as frozen tissue as part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We benchmarked four protocols and show how to apply them in a pooled setting to enable larger studies. We integrated the cross-tissue atlas using a conditional variational autoencoder, annotated it with 43 broad and 74 fine categories, and demonstrated its use to decipher tissue residency, such as a macrophage dichotomy and lipid associations that are preserved across tissues, and tissue-specific fibroblast features, including lung alveolar fibroblasts with likely roles in mechanosensation. We relate cells to human disease biology and disease-risk genes for both rare and common diseases, including rare muscle disease gene groups enriched in distinct subsets of myonuclei and nonmyocytes, and cell type–specific enrichment of expression and splicing quantitative trait locus (QTL) target genes mapped to genome-wide association study loci.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              Our framework will empower large, cross-tissue population and/or disease studies at single-cell resolution. These frameworks and the cross-tissue perspective provided here will form a basis for larger-scale future studies to improve our understanding of cross-tissue and cross-individual variation of cellular phenotypes in relation to disease-associated genetic variation.\n              \n                \n                  Cross-tissue snRNA-seq atlas in eight frozen, archived adult human tissues.\n                  Tissue sites and experimental pipeline (top row).

  {"id":"erlerBayesianImputationTimevarying2019","abstract":"Studies involving large observational datasets commonly face the challenge of dealing with multiple missing values. The most popular approach to overcome this challenge, multiple imputation using chained equations, however, has been shown to be sub-optimal in complex settings, specifically in settings with longitudinal outcomes, which cannot be easily and adequately included in the imputation models. Bayesian methods avoid this difficulty by specification of a joint distribution and thus offer an alternative. A popular choice for that joint distribution is the multivariate normal distribution. In more complicated settings, as in our two motivating examples that involve time-varying covariates, additional issues require consideration: the endo- or exogeneity of the covariate and its functional relation with the outcome. In such situations, the implied assumptions of standard methods may be violated, resulting in bias. In this work, we extend and study a more flexible, Bayesian alternative to the multivariate normal approach, to better handle complex incomplete longitudinal data. We discuss and compare assumptions of the two Bayesian approaches about the endo- or exogeneity of the covariates and the functional form of the association with the outcome, and illustrate and evaluate consequences of violations of those assumptions using simulation studies and two real data examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Erler","given":"Nicole S"},{"family":"Rizopoulos","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Jaddoe","given":"Vincent WV"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Oscar H"},{"family":"Lesaffre","given":"Emmanuel MEH"}],"citation-key":"erlerBayesianImputationTimevarying2019","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/0962280217730851","ISSN":"0962-2802","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,1]]},"page":"555-568","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Bayesian imputation of time-varying covariates in linear mixed models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280217730851","volume":"28"},

The outcomes of surgery and perioperative therapy are limited, and several patients are not candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and have no further alternatives available. In recent years, many drugs have been evaluated in the metastatic setting. This review summarizes the evidence of perioperative treatment with these new drugs for MIBC, emphasizing immunotherapy and targeted agents.\n\nAbstract\nCisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy is the current standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, less than half of patients are candidates for this treatment, and 50% will develop metastatic disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy could be offered if neoadjuvant treatment has not been administered for suitable patients. It is important to reduce the risk of systemic recurrence and improve the prognosis of localized MIBC. Systemic therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma has evolved in recent years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents, such as antibody-drug conjugates or FGFR inhibitors, are new therapeutic alternatives and have shown their benefit in advanced disease. Currently, several clinical trials are investigating the role of these drugs, as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings with promising outcomes.

This review aims to summarize the current evidence and future perspectives of bladder-sparing therapy for MIBC.\n\nMethods\nA non-systematic Medline/PubMed literature search was conducted on July 2022 with the following keywords ‘MIBC’, ‘bladder-sparing’, ‘chemotherapy’, ‘radiotherapy’, ‘trimodal’, ‘multimodal’, and ‘immunotherapy’.\n\nKey Content and Findings\nAll monotherapies are inferior to RC or combination therapy and should not be routinely used for curative intent. Radiotherapy (RT) alone has been shown to have poorer outcomes when compared to chemoradiotherapy. The ideal selection criteria for TMT include good bladder function and capacity, clinical stage within cT2, complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), no prior history of pelvic RT, no extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS), and absence of hydronephrosis. The emergence of immunotherapy may further increase the effect of bladder-sparing therapy. Novel predictive biomarkers are awaited for more precise patient selection and better oncological outcomes.\n\nConclusions\nTMT is a well-tolerated and offers a curative alternative approach to RC for selected patients with localized MIBC.

  {"id":"fanBuildingPrognosticModels2011","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Multiple breast cancer gene expression profiles have been developed that appear to provide similar abilities to predict outcome and may outperform clinical-pathologic criteria; however, the extent to which seemingly disparate profiles provide additive prognostic information is not known, nor do we know whether prognostic profiles perform equally across clinically defined breast cancer subtypes. We evaluated whether combining the prognostic powers of standard breast cancer clinical variables with a large set of gene expression signatures could improve on our ability to predict patient outcomes.\nMETHODS: Using clinical-pathological variables and a collection of 323 gene expression \"modules\", including 115 previously published signatures, we build multivariate Cox proportional hazards models using a dataset of 550 node-negative systemically untreated breast cancer patients. Models predictive of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were also built using this approach.\nRESULTS: We identified statistically significant prognostic models for relapse-free survival (RFS) at 7 years for the entire population, and for the subgroups of patients with ER-positive, or Luminal tumors. Furthermore, we found that combined models that included both clinical and genomic parameters improved prognostication compared with models with either clinical or genomic variables alone. Finally, we were able to build statistically significant combined models for pathological complete response (pCR) predictions for the entire population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Integration of gene expression signatures and clinical-pathological factors is an improved method over either variable type alone. Highly prognostic models could be created when using all patients, and for the subset of patients with lymph node-negative and ER-positive breast cancers. Other variables beyond gene expression and clinical-pathological variables, like gene mutation status or DNA copy number changes, will be needed to build robust prognostic models for ER-negative breast cancer patients. This combined clinical and genomics model approach can also be used to build predictors of therapy responsiveness, and could ultimately be applied to other tumor types.","author":[{"family":"Fan","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Prat","given":"Aleix"},{"family":"Parker","given":"Joel S."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yufeng"},{"family":"Carey","given":"Lisa A."},{"family":"Troester","given":"Melissa A."},{"family":"Perou","given":"Charles M."}],"citation-key":"fanBuildingPrognosticModels2011","container-title":"BMC medical genomics","container-title-short":"BMC Med Genomics","DOI":"10.1186/1755-8794-4-3","ISSN":"1755-8794","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"3","PMCID":"PMC3025826","PMID":"21214954","source":"PubMed","title":"Building prognostic models for breast cancer patients using clinical variables and hundreds of gene expression signatures","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"fengMonitoringMachineLearning2023","abstract":"Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions (CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. A simple approach is to ignore CMI and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring CMI may inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk and (ii) evolution in both the model and clinician trust in the model can induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible if one monitors conditional performance and if either conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection bias hold. Specifically, we develop a new score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits. Through simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of combining model updating with monitoring and investigate how over-trust in a prediction model may delay detection of performance deterioration. Finally, we illustrate how these monitoring methods can be used to detect calibration decay of an ML-based risk calculator for postoperative nausea and vomiting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Gossmann","given":"Alexej"},{"family":"Pennello","given":"Gene"},{"family":"Petrick","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Sahiner","given":"Berkman"},{"family":"Pirracchio","given":"Romain"}],"citation-key":"fengMonitoringMachineLearning2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,14]]},"number":"arXiv:2211.09781","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Monitoring machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction algorithms in the presence of confounding medical interventions","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09781"},
  {"id":"ferreira_2021","abstract":"Background\nBayesian methods, with the predictive probability (PredP), allow multiple interim analyses with interim posterior probability (PostP) computation, without the need to correct for multiple looks at the data. The objective of this paper was to illustrate the use of PredP by simulating a sequential analysis of a clinical trial.\nMethods\nWe used data from the Laryngobloc trial that planned to include 480 patients to demonstrate the equivalence of success between a laryngoscopy performed with the Laryngobloc® device and a control device. A crossover Bayesian design was used. The success rates of the two laryngoscopy devices were compared. Interim analyses, computed from random numbers of subjects, were simulated.\nResults\nThe PostP of equivalence rapidly reached the predefined bound of 0.95. The PredP computed with an equivalence margin of 10% reached the efficacy bound between 352 and 409 of the 480 included patients. If a frequentist analysis had been made on the basis of 217 out of 480 subjects, the study would have been prematurely stopped for equivalence. The PredP indicated that this result was nonetheless unstable and that the equivalence was, thus far, not guaranteed.\nConclusions\nBased on these interim analyses, we can conclude with a sufficiently high probability that the equivalence would have been met on the primary outcome before the predetermined end of this particular trial.

  {"id":"ferrerJointModellingLongitudinal2016","abstract":"Joint modelling of longitudinal and survival data is increasingly used in clinical trials on cancer. In prostate cancer for example, these models permit to account for the link between longitudinal measures of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and time of clinical recurrence when studying the risk of relapse. In practice, multiple types of relapse may occur successively. Distinguishing these transitions between health states would allow to evaluate, for example, how PSA trajectory and classical covariates impact the risk of dying after a distant recurrence post-radiotherapy, or to predict the risk of one specific type of clinical recurrence post-radiotherapy, from the PSA history. In this context, we present a joint model for a longitudinal process and a multi-state process, which is divided into two sub-models: a linear mixed sub-model for longitudinal data and a multi-state sub-model with proportional hazards for transition times, both linked by a function of shared random effects. Parameters of this joint multi-state model are estimated within the maximum likelihood framework using an EM algorithm coupled with a quasi-Newton algorithm in case of slow convergence. It is implemented under R, by combining and extending mstate and JM packages. The estimation program is validated by simulations and applied on pooled data from two cohorts of men with localized prostate cancer. Thanks to the classical covariates available at baseline and the repeated PSA measurements, we are able to assess the biomarker's trajectory, define the risks of transitions between health states and quantify the impact of the PSA dynamics on each transition intensity.

In this Perspective, we discuss the benefits of causal ML (relative to traditional statistical or ML approaches) and outline the key components and steps. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of causal ML and effective translation into the clinic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Feuerriegel","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Frauen","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Melnychuk","given":"Valentyn"},{"family":"Schweisthal","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Hess","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Curth","given":"Alicia"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Kilbertus","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Kohane","given":"Isaac S."},{"family":"Schaar","given":"Mihaela","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"feuerriegel_2024","container-title":"Nature Medicine","container-title-short":"Nat Med","DOI":"10.1038/s41591-024-02902-1","ISSN":"1546-170X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 Springer Nature America, Inc.","page":"958-968","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Causal machine learning for predicting treatment outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-02902-1","volume":"30"},

There is particular interest in estimating the causal effects of medical treatments (or other interventions) in circumstances in which a randomized controlled trial is difficult or impossible. However, standard methods for estimating exposure effects in longitudinal studies are biased in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment., This article describes the use of marginal structural models (described by Robins, Hernán, and Brumback [2000]) to estimate exposure or treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. The method is based on deriving inverse-probability-of-treatment weights, which are then used in a pooled logistic regression model to estimate the causal effect of treatment on outcome. We demonstrate the use of marginal structural models to estimate the effect of methotrexate on mortality in persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fewell","given":"Zoe"},{"family":"Hernán","given":"Miguel A."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Frederick"},{"family":"Tilling","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Hyon"},{"family":"Sterne","given":"Jonathan A.

With the growth of single-cell profiling technologies, there has also been a significant increase in data collected from single-cell profilings, resulting in computational challenges to process these massive and complicated datasets. To address these challenges, deep learning (DL) is positioning as a competitive alternative for single-cell analyses besides the traditional machine learning approaches. Here we present a processing pipeline of single-cell RNA-seq data, survey a total of 25 DL algorithms and their applicability for a specific step in the processing pipeline. Specifically, we establish a unified mathematical representation of all variational autoencoder, autoencoder, and generative adversarial network models, compare the training strategies and loss functions for these models, and relate the loss functions of these models to specific objectives of the data processing step. Such presentation will allow readers to choose suitable algorithms for their particular objective at each step in the pipeline. We envision that this survey will serve as an important information portal for learning the application of DL for scRNA-seq analysis and inspire innovative use of DL to address a broader range of new challenges in emerging multi-omics and spatial single-cell sequencing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Flores","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhentao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Ting-He"},{"family":"Hasib","given":"Md Musaddaqui"},{"family":"Chiu","given":"Yu-Chiao"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Zhenqing"},{"family":"Paniagua","given":"Karla"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Sumin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianqiu"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Shou-Jiang"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Yu-Fang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yidong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yufei"}],"citation-key":"floresDeepLearningTackles2021","container-title":"arXiv:2109.12404 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,25]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Deep learning tackles single-cell analysis A survey of deep learning for scRNA-seq analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12404"},

Contribution (1) addresses an important, relevant, and commonplace problem in computational biology, where it is often impossible to validate an algorithm's core assumptions. To accomplish both tasks, we present a battery of simulations that implement OBF with different inputs and challenge each assumption made by OBF. In particular, we examine the robustness of OBF with respect to incorrect input parameters, false independence, imbalanced sample size, and we address the Gaussianity assumption by considering performance on an extensive family of nonGaussian distributions. We address advantages and disadvantages between different priors and optimization criteria throughout. Finally, we evaluate the utility of OBF in biomarker discovery using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and colon cancer microarray datasets, and show that OBF is successful at identifying well-known biomarkers for these diseases that rank low under moderated t-test.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Foroughi pour","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Dalton","given":"Lori A."}],"citation-key":"foroughipour_2020a","container-title":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1109/TCBB.2018.2858814","ISSN":"1557-9964","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"page":"250-263","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Optimal Bayesian Filtering for Biomarker Discovery: Performance and Robustness","title-short":"Optimal Bayesian Filtering for Biomarker Discovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8417895","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"forouzandeh_2022","abstract":"Many researchers try to understand a biological condition by identifying biomarkers. This is typically done using univariate hypothesis testing over a labeled dataset, declaring a feature to be a biomarker if there is a significant statistical difference between its values for the subjects with different outcomes. However, such sets of proposed biomarkers are often not reproducible – subsequent studies often fail to identify the same sets. Indeed, there is often only a very small overlap between the biomarkers proposed in pairs of related studies that explore the same phenotypes over the same distribution of subjects. This paper first defines the Reproducibility Score for a labeled dataset as a measure (taking values between 0 and 1) of the reproducibility of the results produced by a specified fixed biomarker discovery process for a given distribution of subjects. We then provide ways to reliably estimate this score by defining algorithms that produce an over-bound and an under-bound for this score for a given dataset and biomarker discovery process, for the case of univariate hypothesis testing on dichotomous groups. We confirm that these approximations are meaningful by providing empirical results on a large number of datasets and show that these predictions match known reproducibility results. To encourage others to apply this technique to analyze their biomarker sets, we have also created a publicly available website, https://biomarker.shinyapps.io/BiomarkerReprod/, that produces these Reproducibility Score approximations for any given dataset (with continuous or discrete features and binary class labels).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Forouzandeh","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Rutar","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Kalmady","given":"Sunil V."},{"family":"Greiner","given":"Russell"}],"citation-key":"forouzandeh_2022","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0252697","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,28]]},"language":"en","page":"e0252697","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Analyzing biomarker discovery: Estimating the reproducibility of biomarker sets","title-short":"Analyzing biomarker discovery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0252697","volume":"17"},

Testing for interactions is common in the field of personalized medicine, as subgroups with enhanced treatment effects arise when treatment-by-covariate interactions exist. Asymptotic tests can often be performed for simple models, but in many cases, more complex methods are used to identify subgroups, and non-standard test statistics proposed, and asymptotic results may be difficult to obtain. In such cases, it is natural to consider permutation-based tests, which shuffle selected parts of the data in order to remove one or more associations of interest; however, in the case of interactions, it is generally not possible to remove only the associations of interest by simple permutations of the data. We propose a number of alternative permutation-based methods, designed to remove only the associations of interest, but preserving other associations. These methods estimate the interaction term in a model, then create data that “looks like” the original data except that the interaction term has been permuted. The proposed methods are shown to outperform traditional permutation methods in a simulation study. In addition, the proposed methods are illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial of patients with hypertension.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"Jared C."},{"family":"Nan","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Kaciroti","given":"Niko"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Jeremy M.

For this problem, the development of a standard, pre-determined strategy may help to avoid the well-known dangers of subgroup analysis. We present a method developed to find subgroups of enhanced treatment effect. This method, referred to as ‘Virtual Twins’, involves predicting response probabilities for treatment and control ‘twins’ for each subject. The difference in these probabilities is then used as the outcome in a classification or regression tree, which can potentially include any set of the covariates. We define a measure to be the difference between the treatment effect in estimated subgroup and the marginal treatment effect. We present several methods developed to obtain an estimate of , including estimation of using estimated probabilities in the original data, using estimated probabilities in newly simulated data, two cross-validation-based approaches, and a bootstrap-based bias-corrected approach. Results of a simulation study indicate that the Virtual Twins method noticeably outperforms logistic regression with forward selection when a true subgroup of enhanced treatment effect exists. Generally, large sample sizes or strong enhanced treatment effects are needed for subgroup estimation. As an illustration, we apply the proposed methods to data from a randomized clinical trial.

To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20 proteins in ~218,000 cells under ~750 perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-γ signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion.","author":[{"family":"Frangieh","given":"Chris J."},{"family":"Melms","given":"Johannes C."},{"family":"Thakore","given":"Pratiksha I."},{"family":"Geiger-Schuller","given":"Kathryn R."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Luoma","given":"Adrienne M."},{"family":"Cleary","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Jerby-Arnon","given":"Livnat"},{"family":"Malu","given":"Shruti"},{"family":"Cuoco","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Maryann"},{"family":"Ager","given":"Casey R."},{"family":"Rogava","given":"Meri"},{"family":"Hovey","given":"Lila"},{"family":"Rotem","given":"Asaf"},{"family":"Bernatchez","given":"Chantale"},{"family":"Wucherpfennig","given":"Kai W."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Bruce E."},{"family":"Rozenblatt-Rosen","given":"Orit"},{"family":"Schadendorf","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Regev","given":"Aviv"},{"family":"Izar","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"frangiehMultimodalPooledPerturbCITEseq2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00779-1","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"332-341","PMCID":"PMC8376399","PMID":"33649592","source":"PubMed","title":"Multimodal pooled Perturb-CITE-seq screens in patient models define mechanisms of cancer immune evasion","type":"article-journal","volume":"53"},

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Friedman","given":"Jerome"},{"family":"Hastie","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"friedmanAdditiveLogisticRegression2000","container-title":"The Annals of Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/aos/1016218223","ISSN":"0090-5364, 2168-8966","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",4]]},"page":"337-407","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Additive logistic regression: a statistical view of boosting (With discussion and a rejoinder by the authors)","title-short":"Additive logistic regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-28/issue-2/Additive-logistic-regression--a-statistical-view-of-boosting-With/10.1214/aos/1016218223.full","volume":"28"},

We initiated a phase 2 study in which patients with MIBC received four cycles of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus nivolumab followed by clinical restaging. Patients achieving a clinical complete response (cCR) could proceed without cystectomy. The co-primary objectives were to assess the cCR rate and the positive predictive value of cCR for a composite outcome: 2-year metastasis-free survival in patients forgoing immediate cystectomy or <ypT1N0 in patients electing immediate cystectomy. Seventy-six patients were enrolled; of these, 33 achieved a cCR (43%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 32%, 55%), and 32 of 33 who achieved a cCR opted to forgo immediate cystectomy. The positive predictive value of cCR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91, 1), meeting the co-primary objective. The most common adverse events were fatigue, anemia, neutropenia and nausea.

  {"id":"gavishHallmarksTranscriptionalIntratumour2023","abstract":"Each tumour contains diverse cellular states that underlie intratumour heterogeneity (ITH), a central challenge of cancer therapeutics1. Dozens of recent studies have begun to describe ITH by single-cell RNA sequencing, but each study typically profiled only a small number of tumours and provided a narrow view of transcriptional ITH2. Here we curate, annotate and integrate the data from 77 different studies to reveal the patterns of transcriptional ITH across 1,163 tumour samples covering 24 tumour types. Among the malignant cells, we identify 41 consensus meta-programs, each consisting of dozens of genes that are coordinately upregulated in subpopulations of cells within many tumours. The meta-programs cover diverse cellular processes including both generic (for example, cell cycle and stress) and lineage-specific patterns that we map into 11 hallmarks of transcriptional ITH. Most meta-programs of carcinoma cells are similar to those identified in non-malignant epithelial cells, suggesting that a large fraction of malignant ITH programs are variable even before oncogenesis, reflecting the biology of their cell of origin. We further extended the meta-program analysis to six common non-malignant cell types and utilize these to map cell–cell interactions within the tumour microenvironment. In summary, we have assembled a comprehensive pan-cancer single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset, which is available through the Curated Cancer Cell Atlas website, and leveraged this dataset to carry out a systematic characterization of transcriptional ITH.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gavish","given":"Avishai"},{"family":"Tyler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Greenwald","given":"Alissa C."},{"family":"Hoefflin","given":"Rouven"},{"family":"Simkin","given":"Dor"},{"family":"Tschernichovsky","given":"Roi"},{"family":"Galili Darnell","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Somech","given":"Einav"},{"family":"Barbolin","given":"Chaya"},{"family":"Antman","given":"Tomer"},{"family":"Kovarsky","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Gonzalez Castro","given":"L.

  {"id":"gebregziabherJointModelingMultiple2013","abstract":"The common approach to modeling healthcare cost data is to use aggregated total cost from multiple categories or sources (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, prescriptions, etc.) as the dependent variable. However, this approach could hide the differential impact of covariates on the different cost categories. An alternative is to model each cost category separately. This could also lead to wrong conclusions due to failure to account for the interdependence among the multiple cost outcomes. Therefore, we propose a multivariate generalized linear mixed model (mGLMM) that allows for joint modeling of longitudinal cost data from multiple sources. We assessed four different approaches, (1) shared random intercept, (2) shared random intercept and slope, (3) separate random intercepts from a joint multivariate distribution, and (4) separate random intercepts and slopes from a joint multivariate distribution. Each of these approaches differs in the way they account for the correlation among the multiple cost outcomes. Comparison was made via goodness of fit measures and residual plots. Longitudinal cost data from a national cohort of 740,195 veterans with diabetes (followed from 2002–2006) was used to demonstrate joint modeling. Among examined models, the separate random intercept approach exhibited the lowest AIC/BIC in both log-normal and gamma GLMMs. However, for our data example, the shared random intercept approach seemed to be sufficient as the more complex models did not lead to qualitatively different conclusions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gebregziabher","given":"M."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Y."},{"family":"Dismuke","given":"C.

  {"id":"gebskiDataMaturityFollowup2018","abstract":"We propose methods to determine the minimum number of subjects remaining at risk after which Kaplan-Meier survival plots for time-to-event outcomes should be curtailed, as, once the number remaining at risk drops below this minimum, the survival estimates are no longer meaningful in the context of the investigation. The size of the decrease of the Kaplan-Meier survival estimate S(t) at time t if one extra event should occur is considered in two ways. In the first approach, the investigator sets a maximum acceptable absolute decrease in S(t) should one extra event occur. In the second, a minimum acceptable number of subjects still at risk is calculated by comparing the size of the decrease in S(t) if an extra event should occur with the variability of the survival estimate had all subjects been followed to that time (confidence interval approach). We recommend calculating both limits for the number still at risk and then making an informed choice in the context of the particular investigation. We explore further how the amount of information actually available can assist in considering issues of data maturity for studies whose outcome of interest is a survival percentage at a particular time point. We illustrate the approaches with a number of published studies having differing sample sizes and censoring issues. In particular, one study was the subject of some controversy regarding how far in time the Kaplan-Meier plot should be extended. The proposed methods allow for limits to be calculated simply using the output provided by most statistical packages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gebski","given":"Val"},{"family":"Garès","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Gibbs","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Byth","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"gebskiDataMaturityFollowup2018","container-title":"International Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"International Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/ije/dyy013","ISSN":"0300-5771","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"page":"850-859","source":"Silverchair","title":"Data maturity and follow-up in time-to-event analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyy013","volume":"47"},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of ﬁxed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efﬁcient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Yajima","given":"Masanao"}],"citation-key":"gelman:2012","container-title":"Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness","container-title-short":"Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness","DOI":"10.1080/19345747.2011.618213","ISSN":"1934-5747, 1934-5739","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4]]},"language":"en","page":"189-211","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Why We (Usually) Don't Have to Worry About Multiple Comparisons","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19345747.2011.618213","volume":"5"},

Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modeling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and poststratification can at least adjust for known differences between sample and population. We demonstrate these models with code in R and Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of COVID-19 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area.

Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Vehtari","given":"Aki"},{"family":"Simpson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Margossian","given":"Charles C."},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Bob"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yuling"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Gabry","given":"Jonah"},{"family":"Bürkner","given":"Paul-Christian"},{"family":"Modrák","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"gelmanBayesianWorkflow2020b","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2011.01808","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2011.01808","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Bayesian Workflow","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808"},

Statistical models can predict the absolute risk of an event such as cardiovascular death in the presence of competing risks such as death due to other causes. For personalized medicine and patient counseling, it is necessary to check that the model is calibrated in the sense that it provides reliable predictions for all subjects. There are three often encountered practical problems when the aim is to display or test if a risk prediction model is well calibrated. The first is lack of independent validation data, the second is right censoring, and the third is that when the risk scale is continuous, the estimation problem is as difficult as density estimation. To deal with these problems, we propose to estimate calibration curves for competing risks models based on jackknife pseudo-values that are combined with a nearest neighborhood smoother and a cross-validation approach to deal with all three problems.

  {"id":"ghosh:2015","abstract":"In this article, we highlight some interesting facts about Bayesian variable selection methods for linear regression models in settings where the design matrix exhibits strong collinearity. We first demonstrate via real data analysis and simulation studies that summaries of the posterior distribution based on marginal and joint distributions may give conflicting results for assessing the importance of strongly correlated covariates. The natural question is which one should be used in practice. The simulation studies suggest that posterior inclusion probabilities and Bayes factors that evaluate the importance of correlated covariates jointly are more appropriate, and some priors may be more adversely affected in such a setting. To obtain a better understanding behind the phenomenon, we study some toy examples with Zellner’s g-prior. The results show that strong collinearity may lead to a multimodal posterior distribution over models, in which joint summaries are more appropriate than marginal summaries. Thus, we recommend a routine examination of the correlation matrix and calculation of the joint inclusion probabilities for correlated covariates, in addition to marginal inclusion probabilities, for assessing the importance of covariates in Bayesian variable selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Joyee"},{"family":"Ghattas","given":"Andrew E."}],"citation-key":"ghosh:2015","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2015.1031827","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,3]]},"page":"165-173","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Bayesian Variable Selection Under Collinearity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2015.1031827","volume":"69"},

The use of biomarkers in cancer has been advocated for a variety of purposes, which include use as surrogate endpoints, early detection of disease, proxies for environmental exposure and risk prediction. We deal with the latter issue in this paper. Several authors have proposed use of the predictiveness curve for assessing the capacity of a biomarker for risk prediction. For most situations, it is reasonable to assume monotonicity of the biomarker eﬀects on disease risk. In this article, we propose the use of ﬂexible modelling of the predictiveness curve and its bivariate analogue, the predictiveness surface, through the use of spline algorithms that incorporate the appropriate monotonicity constraints. Estimation proceeds through use of a two-step algorithm that represents the “smooth, then monotonize” approach. Subsampling procedures are used for inference.

  {"id":"giannoniOptimalPrognosticThresholds2014","abstract":"Background Clinicians are sometimes advised to make decisions using thresholds in measured variables, derived from prognostic studies. Objectives We studied why there are conflicting apparently-optimal prognostic thresholds, for example in exercise peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), ejection fraction (EF), and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in heart failure (HF). Data Sources and Eligibility Criteria Studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds in heart failure, published between 1990 and 2010, listed on Pubmed. Methods First, we examined studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds. Second, we created repeated simulations of 1500 patients to identify whether an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold indicates step change in risk. Results 33 studies (8946 patients) tested a pVO2 threshold. 18 found it prognostically significant: the actual reported threshold ranged widely (10–18 ml/kg/min) but was overwhelmingly controlled by the individual study population's mean pVO2 (r = 0.86, p<0.00001). In contrast, the 15 negative publications were testing thresholds 199% further from their means (p = 0.0001). Likewise, of 35 EF studies (10220 patients), the thresholds in the 22 positive reports were strongly determined by study means (r = 0.90, p<0.0001). Similarly, in the 19 positives of 20 BNP studies (9725 patients): r = 0.86 (p<0.0001). Second, survival simulations always discovered a “most significant” threshold, even when there was definitely no step change in mortality. With linear increase in risk, the apparently-optimal threshold was always near the sample mean (r = 0.99, p<0.001). Limitations This study cannot report the best threshold for any of these variables; instead it explains how common clinical research procedures routinely produce false thresholds. Key Findings First, shifting (and/or disappearance) of an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold is strongly determined by studies' average pVO2, EF or BNP. Second, apparently-optimal thresholds always appear, even with no step in prognosis. Conclusions Emphatic therapeutic guidance based on thresholds from observational studies may be ill-founded. We should not assume that optimal thresholds, or any thresholds, exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Giannoni","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Baruah","given":"Resham"},{"family":"Leong","given":"Tora"},{"family":"Rehman","given":"Michaela B."},{"family":"Pastormerlo","given":"Luigi Emilio"},{"family":"Harrell","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Coats","given":"Andrew J.

  {"id":"gill_2024","abstract":"Background: Analysis of samples at the single-cell level offers insights into cellular heterogeneity and cell function. Cell type annotation is the first critical step for performing such an analysis. While current methods primarily utilize single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for annotation, several studies have demonstrated improved classification accuracy by combining scRNA-seq with transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) using unsupervised methods. However, the utility of ATAC-seq features for supervised cell-type annotation has not been explored.Aims/Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative performance of supervised cell-type classification using scRNA-seq alone vs. in multimodal combination with ATAC-seq; and how these data interplay with choice of classification and dimensionality reduction methods.Methods: A peripheral-blood mononuclear cell multi-omic dataset from a single, healthy female donor wasanalysed in this study. Ground truth annotations were generated using unsupervised annotation with the weighted nearest neighbour clustering method. Two dimensionality reduction methods (principal component analysis (PCA), single-cell Variational Inference (scVI) autoencoder) and four classification models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM)) were implemented and performance metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall) were compared over 10 bootstrap samples.Results: ATAC-seq features improved annotation quality and prediction confidence when using scVI embeddings, independent of the classifier. The best-performing model (SVM with scVI embeddings) showed an increase from a median macro F1 score of 0.907 (IQR = [0.902, 0.910]) using scRNA-seq alone to 0.946 (IQR = [0.940, 0.949], p &lt;0.05) with ATAC-seq added. For PCA embeddings, improvements in macro F1 score were insignificant.All cell types (B, T, monocytes, natural killer and dendritic cells) showed significant improvements when using ATAC-seq with scVI embeddings. CD4 T effector memory cells showed the largest gain in F1 score (0.112, p &lt;0.01), whilst type-2 conventional dendritic cells showed the smallest improvement (0.006, p &lt;0.05). Prediction confidence was improved in B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, CD4 and CD8 naïve cells, CD4 T central memory cells and CD8 T effector memory cells. Improvements in F1 scores were lost when only classifying major cell types rather than subtypes.Conclusions: Employing ATAC-seq embeddings with scVI autoencoder enhances supervised annotation quality over scRNA-only methods. Further studies should explore the use of ATAC to improve the annotation of highly heterogeneous tissues such as tumours.Citation Format: Jaidip Gill, Abhijit Dasgupta, Brychan Manry, Natasha Markuzon.

  {"id":"Gillan2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder of automatic, uncontrollable behaviors and obsessive rumination. There is evidence that OCD patients have difficulties performing goal-directed actions, instead exhibiting repetitive stimulus-response habit behaviors. This might result from the excessive formation of stimulus-response habit associations or from an impairment in the ability to use outcome value to guide behavior. We investigated the latter by examining counterfactual decision making, which is the ability to use comparisons of prospective action-outcome scenarios to guide economic choice. METHODS: We tested decision making (forward counterfactual) and affective responses (backward counterfactual) in 20 OCD patients and 20 matched healthy control subjects using an economic choice paradigm that previously revealed attenuation of both the experience and avoidance of counterfactual emotion in schizophrenia patients and patients with orbitofrontal cortex lesions. RESULTS: The use of counterfactual comparison to guide decision making was diminished in OCD patients, who relied primarily on expected value. Unlike the apathetic affective responses previously shown to accompany this decision style, OCD patients reported increased emotional responsivity to the outcomes of their choices and to the counterfactual comparisons that typify regret and relief. CONCLUSIONS: Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients exhibit a pattern of decision making consistent with a disruption in goal-directed forward modeling, basing decisions instead on the temporally present (and more rational) calculation of expected value. In contrast to this style of decision making, emotional responses in OCD were more extreme and reactive than control subjects. These results are in line with an account of disrupted goal-directed cognitive control in OCD.","author":[{"family":"Gillan","given":"Claire M"},{"family":"Morein-Zamir","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Kaser","given":"Muzaffer"},{"family":"Fineberg","given":"Naomi A"},{"family":"Sule","given":"Akeem"},{"family":"Sahakian","given":"Barbara J"},{"family":"Cardinal","given":"Rudolf N"},{"family":"Robbins","given":"Trevor W"}],"citation-key":"Gillan2013","container-title":"Biological psychiatry","event-place":"Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute (CMG, SM-Z, NAF, AS, BJS, RNC, TWR); Department of Psychology (CMG, SM-Z, RNC, TWR), University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Critical needs include optimized multigene testing strategies that incorporate evolving genetic data, consistency in GT indications and management, and alternate genetic evaluation models that address the rising demand for genetic services.METHODSA multidisciplinary consensus conference that included experts, stakeholders, and national organization leaders was convened in response to current practice challenges and to develop a genetic implementation framework. Evidence review informed questions using the modified Delphi model. The final framework included criteria with strong (> 75%) agreement (Recommend) or moderate (50% to 74%) agreement (Consider).RESULTSLarge germline panels and somatic testing were recommended for metastatic PCA. Reflex testing—initial testing of priority genes followed by expanded testing—was suggested for multiple scenarios. Metastatic disease or family history suggestive of hereditary PCA was recommended for GT. Additional family history and pathologic criteria garnered moderate consensus. Priority genes to test for metastatic disease treatment included BRCA2, BRCA1, and mismatch repair genes, with broader testing, such as ATM, for clinical trial eligibility. BRCA2 was recommended for active surveillance discussions. Screening starting at age 40 years or 10 years before the youngest PCA diagnosis in a family was recommended for BRCA2 carriers, with consideration in HOXB13, BRCA1, ATM, and mismatch repair carriers. Collaborative (point-of-care) evaluation models between health care and genetic providers was endorsed to address the genetic counseling shortage. The genetic evaluation framework included optimal pretest informed consent, post-test discussion, cascade testing, and technology-based approaches.CONCLUSIONThis multidisciplinary, consensus-driven PCA genetic implementation framework provides novel guidance to clinicians and patients tailored to the precision era.

Synthetic data has shown promise in finance and economics to improve risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and algorithmic trading. However, higher stakes, potential liabilities, and healthcare practitioner distrust make clinical use of synthetic data difficult. This paper explores the potential benefits and limitations of synthetic data in the healthcare analytics context. We begin with real-world healthcare applications of synthetic data that informs government policy, enhance data privacy, and augment datasets for predictive analytics. We then preview future applications of synthetic data in the emergent field of digital twin technology. We explore the issues of data quality and data bias in synthetic data, which can limit applicability across different applications in the clinical context, and privacy concerns stemming from data misuse and risk of re-identification. Finally, we evaluate the role of regulatory agencies in promoting transparency and accountability and propose strategies for risk mitigation such as Differential Privacy (DP) and a dataset chain of custody to maintain data integrity, traceability, and accountability. Synthetic data can improve healthcare, but measures to protect patient well-being and maintain ethical standards are key to promote responsible use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Giuffrè","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Shung","given":"Dennis L."}],"citation-key":"giuffreHarnessingPowerSynthetic2023","container-title":"npj Digital Medicine","DOI":"10.1038/s41746-023-00927-3","ISSN":"2398-6352","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"page":"186","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Harnessing the power of synthetic data in healthcare: innovation, application, and privacy | npj Digital Medicine","title-short":"Harnessing the power of synthetic data in healthcare","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-023-00927-3","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"goldsteinXCALExplicitCalibration2021","abstract":"Survival analysis models the distribution of time until an event of interest, such as discharge from the hospital or admission to the ICU. When a model's predicted number of events within any time interval is similar to the observed number, it is called well-calibrated. A survival model's calibration can be measured using, for instance, distributional calibration (D-CALIBRATION) [Haider et al., 2020] which computes the squared difference between the observed and predicted number of events within different time intervals. Classically, calibration is addressed in post-training analysis. We develop explicit calibration (X-CAL), which turns D-CALIBRATION into a differentiable objective that can be used in survival modeling alongside maximum likelihood estimation and other objectives. X-CAL allows practitioners to directly optimize calibration and strike a desired balance between predictive power and calibration. In our experiments, we fit a variety of shallow and deep models on simulated data, a survival dataset based on MNIST, on length-of-stay prediction using MIMIC-III data, and on brain cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that the models we study can be miscalibrated. We give experimental evidence on these datasets that X-CAL improves D-CALIBRATION without a large decrease in concordance or likelihood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xintian"},{"family":"Puli","given":"Aahlad"},{"family":"Perotte","given":"Adler J."},{"family":"Ranganath","given":"Rajesh"}],"citation-key":"goldsteinXCALExplicitCalibration2021","container-title":"arXiv:2101.05346 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,13]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"X-CAL: Explicit Calibration for Survival Analysis","title-short":"X-CAL","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05346"},

ML-PIP extends existing probabilistic interpretations of meta-learning to cover a broad class of methods. 2) We introduce VERSA, an instance of the framework employing a flexible and versatile amortization network that takes few-shot learning datasets as inputs, with arbitrary numbers of shots, and outputs a distribution over task-specific parameters in a single forward pass. VERSA substitutes optimization at test time with forward passes through inference networks, amortizing the cost of inference and relieving the need for second derivatives during training. 3) We evaluate VERSA on benchmark datasets where the method sets new state-of-the-art results, handles arbitrary numbers of shots, and for classification, arbitrary numbers of classes at train and test time. The power of the approach is then demonstrated through a challenging few-shot ShapeNet view reconstruction task.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Bronskill","given":"John"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Nowozin","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Richard E."}],"citation-key":"gordonMetaLearningProbabilisticInference2019","container-title":"arXiv:1805.09921 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,6]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Meta-Learning Probabilistic Inference For Prediction","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09921"},

An important step in many scRNA-seq analysis pipelines is the classification of cells into known cell-types. While this can be achieved using experimental techniques, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, these approaches are impractical for large numbers of cells. This motivates the development of data-driven cell-type identification methods. We find limitations with current approaches due to the reliance on known marker genes and sensitivity to the quality of reference samples. Here we present a computationally light statistical approach, based on Naive Bayes, that leverages public datasets to combine information across thousands of genes and probabilistically assign cell-type identity. Using datasets ranging across species and tissue types, we demonstrate that our approach is robust to low-quality reference data and produces more accurate cell-type identification than current methods.","author":[{"family":"Grabski","given":"Isabella N."},{"family":"Irizarry","given":"Rafael A."}],"citation-key":"grabskiProbabilisticGeneExpression2020","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2020.01.05.895441","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,6]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2998512631","title":"Probabilistic gene expression signatures identify cell-types from single cell RNA-seq data","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"gray_2014","abstract":"Purpose\nTo examine the accuracy of clinical staging and its effects on outcome in bladder cancer (BC) patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC), using a large national database.\nMethods and Materials\nA total of 16,953 patients with BC without distant metastases treated with RC from 1998 to 2009 were analyzed. Factors associated with clinical–pathologic stage discrepancy were assessed by multivariate generalized estimating equation models. Survival analysis was conducted for patients treated between 1998 and 2004 (n=7270) using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models.\nResults\nAt RC 41.9% of patients were upstaged, whereas 5.9% were downstaged. Upstaging was more common in females, the elderly, and in patients who underwent a more extensive lymphadenectomy. Downstaging was less common in patients treated at community centers, in the elderly, and in Hispanics. Receipt of preoperative chemotherapy was highly associated with downstaging. Five-year overall survival rates for patients with clinical stages 0, I, II, III, and IV were 67.2%, 62.9%, 50.4%, 36.9%, and 27.2%, respectively, whereas those for the same pathologic stages were 70.8%, 75.8%, 63.7%, 41.5%, and 24.7%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, upstaging was associated with increased 5-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.80, P<.001), but downstaging was not associated with survival (HR 0.88, P=.160). In contrast, more extensive lymphadenectomy was associated with decreased 5-year mortality (HR 0.76 for ≥10 lymph nodes examined, P<.001), as was treatment at an National Cancer Institute–designated cancer center (HR 0.90, P=.042).\nConclusions\nClinical–pathologic stage discrepancy in BC patients is remarkably common across the United States. These findings should be considered when selecting patients for preoperative or nonoperative management strategies and when comparing the outcomes of bladder sparing approaches to RC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Phillip J."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chun Chieh"},{"family":"Jemal","given":"Ahmedin"},{"family":"Shipley","given":"William U."},{"family":"Fedewa","given":"Stacey A."},{"family":"Kibel","given":"Adam S."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Jonathan E."},{"family":"Kamat","given":"Ashish M."},{"family":"Virgo","given":"Katherine S."},{"family":"Blute","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Zietman","given":"Anthony L."},{"family":"Efstathiou","given":"Jason A."}],"citation-key":"gray_2014","container-title":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics","container-title-short":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.01.001","ISSN":"0360-3016","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,1]]},"page":"1048-1056","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Clinical–Pathologic Stage Discrepancy in Bladder Cancer Patients Treated With Radical Cystectomy: Results From the National Cancer Data Base","title-short":"Clinical–Pathologic Stage Discrepancy in Bladder Cancer Patients Treated With Radical Cystectomy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301614000042","volume":"88"},

A key problem is that there are no interpretations of these concepts that are at once simple, intuitive, correct, and foolproof. Instead, correct use and interpretation of these statistics requires an attention to detail which seems to tax the patience of working scientists. This high cognitive demand has led to an epidemic of shortcut definitions and interpretations that are simply wrong, sometimes disastrously so-and yet these misinterpretations dominate much of the scientific literature. In light of this problem, we provide definitions and a discussion of basic statistics that are more general and critical than typically found in traditional introductory expositions. Our goal is to provide a resource for instructors, researchers, and consumers of statistics whose knowledge of statistical theory and technique may be limited but who wish to avoid and spot misinterpretations. We emphasize how violation of often unstated analysis protocols (such as selecting analyses for presentation based on the P values they produce) can lead to small P values even if the declared test hypothesis is correct, and can lead to large P values even if that hypothesis is incorrect.

They are becoming widely available in standard computer packages under the headings of generalized linear mixed models, hierarchical models, and multilevel models. I here argue that such models offer a more scientifically defensible framework for epidemiologic analysis than the fixed-effects models now prevalent in epidemiology. The argument invokes an antiparsimony principle attributed to L. J. Savage, which is that models should be rich enough to reflect the complexity of the relations under study. It also invokes the countervailing principle that you cannot estimate anything if you try to estimate everything (often used to justify parsimony). Regression with random coefficients offers a rational compromise between these principles as well as an alternative to analyses based on standard variable-selection algorithms and their attendant distortion of uncertainty assessments.

  {"id":"Greenstein2014","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Among children ¡13 years of age with persistent psychosis and contemporaneous decline in functioning, it is often difficult to determine if the diagnosis of childhood onset schizophrenia (COS) is warranted. Despite decades of experience, we have up to a 44% false positive screening diagnosis rate among patients identified as having probable or possible COS; final diagnoses are made following inpatient hospitalization and medication washout. Because our lengthy medication-free observation is not feasible in clinical practice, we constructed diagnostic classifiers using screening data to assist clinicians practicing in the community or academic centers. METHODS: We used cross-validation, logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and random forest to determine the best algorithm for classifying COS (n=85) versus histories of psychosis and impaired functioning in children and adolescents who, at screening, were considered likely to have COS, but who did not meet diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia after medication washout and inpatient observation (n=53). We used demographics, clinical history measures, intelligence quotient (IQ) and screening rating scales, and number of typical and atypical antipsychotic medications as our predictors. RESULTS: Logistic regression models using nine, four, and two predictors performed well with positive predictive values¿90%, overall accuracy¿77%, and areas under the curve (AUCs)¿86%. CONCLUSIONS: COS can be distinguished from alternate disorders with psychosis in children and adolescents; greater levels of positive and negative symptoms and lower levels of depression combine to make COS more likely. We include a worksheet so that clinicians in the community and academic centers can predict the probability that a young patient may be schizophrenic, using only two ratings.","author":[{"family":"Greenstein","given":"Deanna"},{"family":"Kataria","given":"Rachna"},{"family":"Gochman","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Malley","given":"James D"},{"family":"Rapoport","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Gogtay","given":"Nitin"}],"citation-key":"Greenstein2014","container-title":"Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9]]},"page":"366-73","PMID":"25019955","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Looking for childhood-onset schizophrenia: diagnostic algorithms for classifying children and adolescents with psychosis.","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, we identified 23 noncomparative prospective or retrospective studies published between 1990 and 2021. The mean bladder and metastatic recurrence rates (range) as well as the mean bladder preservation rate (BPR; range) were calculated, and overall survival (OS) was extracted from included reports.\nEvidence synthesis\nOverall, 16 and seven studies evaluated surveillance (n = 610) and radiation therapy (n = 175) in MIBC patients achieving cCR to initial systemic treatment, respectively. With regard to surveillance, the median follow-up ranged from 10 to 120 mo, with a mean bladder recurrence rate of 43% (0–71%), including 65% of non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 35% of MIBC recurrences. The mean BPR was 73% (49–100%). The mean metastatic recurrence rate was 9% (0–27%), while 5-yr OS rates ranged from 64% to 89%. With regard to radiation therapy, the median follow-up ranged from 12 to 60 mo, with a mean bladder recurrence rate of 15% (0–29%), including 24% of NMIBC, 43% of MIBC, and 33% of unspecified recurrences. The mean BPR was 74% (71–100%). The mean metastatic recurrence rate was 17% (0–22%), while the 4-yr OS rate was 79%.\nConclusions\nOur systematic review showed that only low-level evidence supports the effectiveness of BSSs in selected patients achieving cCR to initial systemic treatment for localized MIBC. These preliminary findings highlight the need for further prospective comparative research to demonstrate its efficacy.\nPatient summary\nWe reviewed studies evaluating bladder-sparing strategies in patients achieving complete clinical response to initial systemic treatment for localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Although abundant frequentist methods have been developed for comparing survival functions, inference procedures from the Bayesian perspective are rather limited. In this article, we extract the quantity of interest from the classic log-rank test and propose its Bayesian counterpart. Monte Carlo methods, including a Gibbs sampler and a sequential importance sampling procedure, are developed to draw posterior samples of survival functions and a decision rule of hypothesis testing is constructed for making inference. Via simulations and real data analysis, the proposed Bayesian log-rank test is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the classic one when noninformative prior distributions are used, which provides a Bayesian interpretation of the log-rank test. When using the correct prior information from historical data, the Bayesian log-rank test is shown to outperform the classic one in terms of power.

Active Stat5 increased metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in nude mice by 11-fold in an experimental metastases assay. Active Stat5 promoted migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells, and induced rearrangement of the microtubule network. Active Stat5 expression was associated with decreased cell surface E-cadherin levels, while heterotypic adhesion of prostate cancer cells to endothelial cells was stimulated by active Stat5. Activation of Stat5 and Stat5-induced binding of prostate cancer cells to endothelial cells were decreased by inhibition of Src but not of Jak2. Gene expression profiling indicated that 21% of Stat5-regulated genes in prostate cancer cells were related to metastases, while 7.9% were related to proliferation and 3.9% to apoptosis.

Stat5a/b and Stat3 are both constitutively active in locally-confined and advanced prostate cancer, and both transcription factors have been reported to be critical for the viability of prostate cancer cells. We recently showed that Stat3 promotes metastatic behavior of human prostate cancer cells not only in vitro but also in an in vivo experimental metastases model. In this work, we compare side-by-side Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in the promotion of prostate cancer cell viability, tumor growth, and induction of metastatic colonization in vivo. Inhibition of Stat5a/b induced massive death of prostate cancer cells in culture and reduced both subcutaneous and orthotopic prostate tumor growth, whereas Stat3 had a predominant role over Stat5a/b in promoting metastases formation of prostate cancer cells in vivo in nude mice. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential biological effects induced by these two transcription factors involve largely different sets of genes regulated by Stat5a/b versus Stat3 in human prostate cancer model systems. Of the two Stat5 homologs, Stat5b was more important for supporting growth of prostate cancer cells than Stat5a.

One of the main applications of scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of new cell types and cell states. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are among the best methods to address this problem. However, this performance comes with the trade-off for a lack of interpretability in the results. In this work we propose an intelligible pathway-driven neural network to correctly solve cell-type related problems at single-cell resolution while providing a biologically meaningful representation of the data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In this study, we explored the deep neural networks constrained by several types of prior biological information, e.g. signaling pathway information, as a way to reduce the dimensionality of the scRNA-seq data. We have tested the proposed biologically-based architectures on thousands of cells of human and mouse origin across a collection of public datasets in order to check the performance of the model. Specifically, we tested the architecture across different validation scenarios that try to mimic how unknown cell types are clustered by the DNN and how it correctly annotates cell types by querying a database in a retrieval problem. Moreover, our approach demonstrated to be comparable to other less interpretable DNN approaches constrained by using protein-protein interactions gene regulation data. Finally, we show how the latent structure learned by the network could be used to visualize and to interpret the composition of human single cell datasets.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Here we demonstrate how the integration of pathways, which convey fundamental information on functional relationships between genes, with DNNs, that provide an excellent classification framework, results in an excellent alternative to learn a biologically meaningful representation of scRNA-seq data. In addition, the introduction of prior biological knowledge in the DNN reduces the size of the network architecture. Comparative results demonstrate a superior performance of this approach with respect to other similar approaches.

  {"id":"guo_2018","abstract":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Intravesical BCG is the ﬁrst-line treatment in high grade non muscle invasive bladder cancer (HG-NMIBC). Forty-50% of these patients experience recurrent disease. Alternative therapeutic strategies to early cystectomy have been developed with the aim to preserve the bladder. The aim of this study was to explore a role of EMDAâ-MMC as ﬁrst line salvage treatment in patients suffering from HGNMIBC unresponsive to BCG.\nMETHODS: A prospective, single-center, non-randomized Phase II study was carried out in order to evaluate the efﬁcacy in terms of response and progression rate and safety of the EMDAâ-MMC treatment in 26 (21 male, 5 female) consecutive patients with HGNMIBC unresponsive after at least one cycle of intravesical immunotherapy with BCG. Patients underwent an EMDAâ-MMC induction cycle (40 mg of MMC diluted in 100 ml of PPI retained in the bladder for 30 minutes with 20 mA pulsed electric current) of 6 weekly instillations and then a monthly maintenance cycle for a total of 6 treatments. Followup was based on bladder bioptic mapping (with sampling in the prostatic urethra for men), voiding and washing urinary cytology and radiological study of the upper urinary tract. In order to analyze disease-free survival Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed and Log-rank test was applied.\nRESULTS: After 3 years of follow-up, 16 patients (56.5%) preserved their native bladder, 10 patients (43.5%) underwent radical cystectomy, in 26.1% of cases (6 patients) for recurrent HGNMIBC and in 17.4% of cases (4 patients) for progression to muscle-invasive disease.Stratifying patients based on TNM classiﬁcation (TaT1G3, Cis or TaT1G3þCis), disease-free rates at 3 years followup were 62,5%, 50% and 33% with statistically signiﬁcant differences (p value < 0.05).Regarding toxicity, 3 patients (11.5%) had a severe adverse systemic event of hypersensitivity to the MMC while 6 patients (26.1%) had local side effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EMDAâ-MMC is a safe and effective tool in the long term conservative treatment of the high-risk NMIBC unresponsive to BCG, as second line “sparing bladder” therapy in selected patients. Multicenter studies with larger number of patients and longer followup may justify a wider use of EMDAâ-MMC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Runqi"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Gengyan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xuesong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Liqun"}],"citation-key":"guo_2018","container-title":"Journal of Urology","container-title-short":"Journal of Urology","DOI":"10.1016/j.juro.2018.02.2751","ISSN":"0022-5347, 1527-3792","issue":"4S","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"MP83-03 DETECTION OF UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA USING SELECTED URINE-DNA METHYLATION BIOMARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH GROSS HEMATURIA: A PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-CENTER STUDY","title-short":"MP83-03 DETECTION OF UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA USING SELECTED URINE-DNA METHYLATION BIOMARKERS IN PATIENTS WITH GROSS HEMATURIA","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jurology.com/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2018.02.2751","volume":"199"},

In this paper, we consider issues relevant in the design of biomedical studies in which the goal is the discovery of a subset of features and an associated algorithm that can predict a binary outcome, such as disease status. We compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in high-dimensionality data settings. We evaluate the effects of varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio in the dataset, imbalance in class distribution and choice of metric for quantifying performance of the classifier. To guide study design, we present a summary of the key characteristics of 'omics' data profiled in several human or animal model experiments utilizing high-content mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassay based techniques.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                The analysis of data from seven 'omics' studies revealed that the average magnitude of effect size observed in human studies was markedly lower when compared to that in animal studies. The data measured in human studies were characterized by higher biological variation and the presence of outliers. The results from simulation studies indicated that the classifier Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM) had the highest power when the class conditional feature distributions were Gaussian and outcome distributions were balanced.

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

Unfortunately, risk scores (e.g., from Cox Proportional Hazard models) do not provide survival probabilities, single-time probability models (e.g., the Gail model, predicting 5 year probability) only provide for a single time point, and standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves provide only population averages for a large class of patients meaning they are not specific to individual patients. This motivates an alternative class of tools that can learn a model which provides an individual survival distribution which gives survival probabilities across all times - such as extensions to the Cox model, Accelerated Failure Time, an extension to Random Survival Forests, and Multi-Task Logistic Regression. This paper first motivates such \"individual survival distribution\" (ISD) models, and explains how they differ from standard models. It then discusses ways to evaluate such models - namely Concordance, 1-Calibration, Brier score, and various versions of L1-loss - and then motivates and defines a novel approach \"D-Calibration\", which determines whether a model's probability estimates are meaningful. We also discuss how these measures differ, and use them to evaluate several ISD prediction tools, over a range of survival datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Haider","given":"Humza"},{"family":"Hoehn","given":"Bret"},{"family":"Davis","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Greiner","given":"Russell"}],"citation-key":"haiderEffectiveWaysBuild2018","container-title":"arXiv:1811.11347 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Effective Ways to Build and Evaluate Individual Survival Distributions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11347"},

  {"id":"halling_","abstract":"Purpose: We determine the relative sensitivities of cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the detection of urothelial carcinoma. Materials and Methods: A mixture of fluorescent labeled probes to the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7 and 17, and band 9p21 (P16/CDKN2A gene) was used to assess urinary cells for chromosomal abnormalities indicative of malignancy. A total of 280 urine specimens from 265 patients, including 150 with a history of urothelial carcinoma and 115 without a history of urothelial carcinoma, were analyzed. FISH analysis was performed without prior knowledge of clinical findings, that is biopsy, cystoscopy and cytology results. A positive result was defined as 5 or more urinary cells with gains of 2 or more chromosomes.\nResults: A total of 75 biopsies showed urothelial carcinoma at FISH analysis among the 265 patients. The sensitivity of urine cytology for pTa (36 cases), pTis (18) and pT1-pT4 (15) tumors was 47%, 78% and 60%, respectively, for an overall sensitivity of 58%. The sensitivity of FISH for pTa (37 cases), pTis (17) and pT1-pT4 (19) tumors was 65%, 100% and 95%, respectively, for an overall sensitivity of 81%. FISH was significantly more sensitive than cytology for pTis (p ϭ 0.046), pT1-pT4 (p ϭ 0.025), grade 3 (p ϭ 0.003) and all tumors (p ϭ 0.001). The specificity of cytology and FISH among patients without cystoscopic evidence of urothelial carcinoma and no history of urothelial carcinoma was 98% and 96%, respectively (p ϭ 0.564).\nConclusions: The sensitivity of FISH for the detection of urothelial carcinoma is superior to that of cytology, and the specificity of FISH and cytology for urothelial carcinoma are not significantly different.

  {"id":"hallUsingBootstrapQuantify2009","abstract":"The bootstrap is a popular and convenient method for quantifying the authority of an empirical ordering of attributes, for example of a ranking of the performance of institutions or of the influence of genes on a response variable. In the first of these examples, the number, $p$, of quantities being ordered is sometimes only moderate in size; in the second it can be very large, often much greater than sample size. However, we show that in both types of problem the conventional bootstrap can produce inconsistency. Moreover, the standard $n$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap estimator of the distribution of an empirical rank may not converge in the usual sense; the estimator may converge in distribution, but not in probability. Nevertheless, in many cases the bootstrap correctly identifies the support of the asymptotic distribution of ranks. In some contemporary problems, bootstrap prediction intervals for ranks are particularly long, and in this context, we also quantify the accuracy of bootstrap methods, showing that the standard bootstrap gets the order of magnitude of the interval right, but not the constant multiplier of interval length. The $m$-out-of-$n$ bootstrap can improve performance and produce statistical consistency, but it requires empirical choice of $m$; we suggest a tuning solution to this problem. We show that in genomic examples, where it might be expected that the standard, ``synchronous'' bootstrap will successfully accommodate nonindependence of vector components, that approach can produce misleading results. An ``independent component'' bootstrap can overcome these difficulties, even in cases where components are not strictly independent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Hugh"}],"citation-key":"hallUsingBootstrapQuantify2009","container-title":"The Annals of Statistics","container-title-short":"Ann.

  {"id":"han_2023","abstract":"Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is the standard of care for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, treatment outcomes are suboptimal. Camrelizumab, a PD-1 blockade, has shown benefits in several tumors. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) followed by RC for MIBC patients. Methods This was a multi-center, single-arm study that enrolled MIBC patients with a clinical stage of T2-4aN0-1M0, and scheduled for RC. Patients received three 21-day cycles of camrelizumab 200 mg on day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and 8, and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 2, followed by RC. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR, pT0N0). Results From May 2020 to July 2021, 43 patients were enrolled and received study medications at nine centers in China. Three of them were deemed ineligible and excluded from efficacy analysis but included in safety analysis. In total 10 patients were unevaluable as they declined RC (two due to adverse events [AEs] and eight due to patient's willingness). Among 30 evaluable patients, 13 patients (43.3%) achieved pCR, and 16 patients (53.3%) achieved pathologic downstaging. No AEs leading to death were observed. The most common AEs were anemia (69.8%), decreased white blood cell count (65.1%), and nausea (65.1%). Immune-related AEs were all grade 1 or 2. Pathologic response was not correlated with PD-L1 expression status or tumor mutation burden. Individual genes as a biomarker for pathologic response were not identified. Conclusions Neoadjuvant treatment with camrelizumab and GC regimen demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity for MIBC patients with manageable safety profiles. The study met its primary endpoint, and the following randomized trial is ongoing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Sujun"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Zhigang"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Xinrong"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Linjun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Ping","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiansong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wanhai"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Benkang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haifeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Honglei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shouzhen"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Hailong"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Jianming"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shen"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Quan"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Nianzeng"}],"citation-key":"han_2023","container-title":"Cancer Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/cam4.5900","ISSN":"2045-7634","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

The derivation of the marginal likelihood based on the original power prior, and its variation, the normalized power prior, introduces a scaling factor C(δ) in the form of a prior predictive distribution with powered likelihood. In this article, we show that the scaling factor might be infinite for some positive δ with conventionally used initial priors, which would change the admissible set of the power parameter. This result seems to have been almost completely ignored in the literature. We then illustrate that such a phenomenon may jeopardize the posterior inference under the power priors when the initial prior of the model parameters is improper. The main findings of this article suggest that special attention should be paid when the suggested level of borrowing is close to 0, while the actual optimum might be below the suggested value.

  {"id":"handorf:2024","abstract":"One of the most common ways researchers compare cancer survival outcomes across treatments from observational data is using Cox regression. This model depends on its underlying assumption of proportional hazards, but in some real-world cases, such as when comparing different classes of cancer therapies, substantial violations may occur. In this situation, researchers have several alternative methods to choose from, including Cox models with time-varying hazard ratios; parametric accelerated failure time models; Kaplan–Meier curves; and pseudo-observations. It is unclear which of these models are likely to perform best in practice. To fill this gap in the literature, we perform a neutral comparison study of candidate approaches. We examine clinically meaningful outcome measures that can be computed and directly compared across each method, namely, survival probability at time T, median survival, and restricted mean survival. To adjust for differences between treatment groups, we use inverse probability of treatment weighting based on the propensity score. We conduct simulation studies under a range of scenarios, and determine the biases, coverages, and standard errors of the average treatment effects for each method. We then demonstrate the use of these approaches using two published observational studies of survival after cancer treatment. The first examines chemotherapy in sarcoma, which has a late treatment effect (i.e., similar survival initially, but after 2 years the chemotherapy group shows a benefit). The other study is a comparison of surgical techniques for kidney cancer, where survival differences are attenuated over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Handorf","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Smaldone","given":"Marc C."},{"family":"Movva","given":"Sujana"},{"family":"Mitra","given":"Nandita"}],"citation-key":"handorf:2024","container-title":"Biometrical Journal","DOI":"10.1002/bimj.202200099","ISSN":"1521-4036","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","page":"202200099","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analysis of survival data with nonproportional hazards: A comparison of propensity-score-weighted methods","title-short":"Analysis of survival data with nonproportional hazards","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bimj.202200099","volume":"66"},

  {"id":"harrellIntroductionBayesEvaluating2022","abstract":"P-values and the p < 0.05 rule of thumb came into use before the computing revolution. Assuming the null hypothesis is true greatly simplified the model, often requiring only manual calculations. But the traditional straw-man null hypothesis testing approach to establishing statistical evidence about efficacy or safety of a drug has a number of deficiencies, many of them caused by the indirectness of the approach, including the use of probabilities of events that already occurred conditional on facts that are unknown. P-values and type I errors are often assumed to provide the error probabilities regulators need, but the chance of approving an ineffective drug given the data is actually the direct Bayesian posterior probability that efficacy falls below an acceptable level. Furthermore, the rules of logic supporting proof by contradiction, based on certainties and not probabiities, don’t apply to the uncertainties of traditional null hypothesis testing. Just as in medical diagnosis, forward probabilistic thinking leads to optimum decisions. The Bayesian approach involves direct estimation of time-forward probabilities of clinical interest and does not need to concern itself with long-run operating characteristics such as the number of false positives from a large set of imagined exact replications of exactly null clinical trials. Instead, Bayesian methods aim to maximize the probability of making the best decision about drug efficacy and safety for the single problem at hand. The Bayesian approach applies to complex study designs, incorporates applicable prior information, results in cleaner interpretations on a clinical as opposed to randomness scale, and provides a fully self-contained model-based approach to inference needing no after-the-fact adjustments for context/multiplicities. In some ways frequentist hypothesis testing involves modeling noise while Bayesian inference involves modeling signal.\n\nThe Bayesian approach is outlined, and demonstrated through relatively simple simulations. By focusing on an extreme example in which one analyzes the data up to 500 times for 500 subjects, the advantages of Bayes for evidence generation and saving sample size by earlier stopping are shown. A simulated parallel-group randomized clinical trial with two efficacy endpoints is used to demonstrate how Bayes is used to quantify evidence for efficacy with joint probabilities involving both outcomes, something impossible to calculate in the frequentist paradigm.\n\nBayesian methods should be used for simple problems as well as for complex situations such as adaptive designs and use of prior data where a frequentist solution is not available. When sponsors and reviewers are comfortable applying and interpreting Bayesian methods in simple cases they will be more able to interpret results in complex situations. When relevant prior data are not available for incorporation into the prior distribution, a little skepticism goes a long way.","author":[{"family":"Harrell","given":"Frank E"}],"citation-key":"harrellIntroductionBayesEvaluating2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Introduction to Bayes for Evaluating Treatments","type":"book","URL":"http://hbiostat.org/doc/bayes/course.html"},

According to conventional wisdom, a Bayesian approach (unlike a frequentist approach) requires no adjustment for selection, which is generally regarded as counterintuitive and even paradoxical. An alternative considered herein consists (when taking a Bayesian approach in the face of selection) of basing the inferences for the value of θ on the posterior distribution derived from the conditional (on y∈S ) joint distribution of y and θ . That leads to an adjustment in the likelihood function that is reinterpretable as an adjustment to the prior distribution and ultimately leads to a different posterior distribution. And it serves to make the inferences specific to settings that are subject to selection of the same kind as the setting that gave rise to the data. Moreover, even in the absence of any real selection, this approach can be used to make the inferences specific to a meaningful subset of y-values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Harville","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"harville:2022","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2020.1858963","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,2]]},"page":"22-28","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Bayesian Inference Is Unaffected by Selection: Fact or Fiction?","title-short":"Bayesian Inference Is Unaffected by Selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2020.1858963","volume":"76"},

  {"id":"hawkins-hookerGeneratingFunctionalProtein2021","abstract":"The vast expansion of protein sequence databases provides an opportunity for new protein design approaches which seek to learn the sequence-function relationship directly from natural sequence variation. Deep generative models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, but their potential for direct use in the design of novel proteins remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the luxA bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To confirm the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of luxA whose luminescence activity was validated experimentally. We further showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of luxA without disrupting function. Altogether 6/12 of the variants generated using the unconditional AR-VAE and 9/11 generated using the unconditional MSA VAE retained measurable luminescence, together with all 23 of the less distant variants generated by conditional versions of the models; the most distant functional variant contained 35 differences relative to the nearest training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawkins-Hooker","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Depardieu","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Baur","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Couairon","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Bikard","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"hawkins-hookerGeneratingFunctionalProtein2021","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008736","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e1008736","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Generating functional protein variants with variational autoencoders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008736","volume":"17"},

The performance of different noninformative priors under small sample sizes is compared using the likelihood combining both fitting and prediction performances.

  {"id":"heath_2020","abstract":"Background/Aims\nNon-inferiority trials investigate whether a novel intervention, which typically has other benefits (i.e., cheaper or safer), has similar clinical effectiveness to currently available treatments. In situations where interim evidence in a non-inferiority trial suggests that the novel treatment is truly inferior, ethical concerns with continuing randomisation to the “inferior” intervention are raised. Thus, if interim data indicate that concluding non-inferiority at the end of the trial is unlikely, stopping for futility should be considered. To date, limited examples are available to guide the development of stopping rules for non-inferiority trials.\nMethods\nWe used a Bayesian predictive power approach to develop a stopping rule for futility for a trial collecting binary outcomes. We evaluated the frequentist operating characteristics of the stopping rule to ensure control of the Type I and Type II error. Our case study is the Intranasal Ketamine for Procedural Sedation trial (INK trial), a non-inferiority trial designed to assess the sedative properties of ketamine administered using two alternative routes.\nResults\nWe considered implementing our stopping rule after the INK trial enrols 140 patients out of 560. The trial would be stopped if 12 more patients experience a failure on the novel treatment compared to standard care. This trial has a type I error rate of 2.2% and a power of 80%.\nConclusions\nStopping for futility in non-inferiority trials reduces exposure to ineffective treatments and preserves resources for alternative research questions. Futility stopping rules based on Bayesian predictive power are easy to implement and align with trial aims.\nTrial registration\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02828566 July 11, 2016.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Heath","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Offringa","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Pechlivanoglou","given":"Petros"},{"family":"Rios","given":"Juan David"},{"family":"Klassen","given":"Terry P."},{"family":"Poonai","given":"Naveen"},{"family":"Pullenayegum","given":"Eleanor"}],"citation-key":"heath_2020","container-title":"Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications","container-title-short":"Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.conctc.2020.100561","ISSN":"2451-8654","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,1]]},"page":"100561","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Determining a Bayesian predictive power stopping rule for futility in a non-inferiority trial with binary outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451865420300454","volume":"18"},

Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and five independent clinical studies demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used sparsity-promoting regularization methods while maintaining predictive performance; it distills datasets containing 1,400–35,000 features down to 4–34 candidate biomarkers.

  {"id":"henderson_2020","abstract":"Summary\n            Individuals often respond differently to identical treatments, and characterizing such variability in treatment response is an important aim in the practice of personalized medicine. In this article, we describe a nonparametric accelerated failure time model that can be used to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) when patient outcomes are time-to-event. By utilizing Bayesian additive regression trees and a mean-constrained Dirichlet process mixture model, our approach offers a flexible model for the regression function while placing few restrictions on the baseline hazard. Our nonparametric method leads to natural estimates of individual treatment effect and has the flexibility to address many major goals of HTE assessment. Moreover, our method requires little user input in terms of model specification for treatment covariate interactions or for tuning parameter selection. Our procedure shows strong predictive performance while also exhibiting good frequentist properties in terms of parameter coverage and mitigation of spurious findings of HTE. We illustrate the merits of our proposed approach with a detailed analysis of two large clinical trials (N = 6769) for the prevention and treatment of congestive heart failure using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The analysis revealed considerable evidence for the presence of HTE in both trials as demonstrated by substantial estimated variation in treatment effect and by high proportions of patients exhibiting strong evidence of having treatment effects which differ from the overall treatment effect.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Henderson","given":"Nicholas C"},{"family":"Louis","given":"Thomas A"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Gary L"},{"family":"Varadhan","given":"Ravi"}],"citation-key":"henderson_2020","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy028","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"50-68","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Individualized treatment effects with censored data via fully nonparametric Bayesian accelerated failure time models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/21/1/50/5056258","volume":"21"},

Observational studies had previously suggested reduced CHD risk in hormone users.\n          Methods: \n          Using data from the observational Nurses’ Health Study, we emulated the design and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the randomized trial. The observational study was conceptualized as a sequence of “trials,” in which eligible women were classified as initiators or noninitiators of estrogen/progestin therapy.\n          Results: \n          The ITT hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals) of CHD for initiators versus noninitiators were 1.42 (0.92–2.20) for the first 2 years, and 0.96 (0.78–1.18) for the entire follow-up.

These ITT estimates are similar to those from the Women's Health Initiative. Because the ITT approach causes severe treatment misclassification, we also estimated adherence-adjusted effects by inverse probability weighting.

  {"id":"hernan:2018","abstract":"<p>When using observational data, quantifying the effect of treatment duration on survival outcomes is not straightforward because only people who live for a long time can receive treatment for a long time. This problem doesn’t apply to randomised trials because people are classified based on the treatment duration they are assigned, rather than the treatment duration that they achieve. This approach accepts that dead people do not deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. By transferring this insight to the analysis of observational data, we can follow three steps to estimate the effect of treatment duration from observational data without the bias of naive comparisons between long term and short term users. The first step is cloning people to assign them to multiple treatment strategies. The second step is censoring clones when they deviate from their assigned treatment strategy. The third step is performing inverse probability weighting to adjust for the potential selection bias introduced by censoring. The procedure can be used to compare any treatment strategies that are sustained over time. Cloning, censoring, and weighting eliminates immortal time bias in the estimates of absolute and relative risk, which helps researchers focus their attention on other biases that may be present in observational analyses and are not so easily eliminated.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hernán","given":"Miguel A."}],"citation-key":"hernan:2018","container-title":"BMJ","container-title-short":"BMJ","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.k182","ISSN":"0959-8138, 1756-1833","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,1]]},"language":"en","license":"Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In contrast, the recently developed marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. We describe an MSM for repeated measures that parameterizes the marginal means of counterfactual outcomes corresponding to prespecified treatment regimes. The parameters of MSMs are estimated using a new class of estimators - inverse-probability of treatment weighted estimators. We used an MSM to estimate the effect of zidovudine therapy on mean CD4 count among HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. We estimated a potential expected increase of 5.4 (95 per cent confidence interval -1.8,12.7) CD4 lymphocytes/l per additional study visit while on zidovudine therapy. We also explain the theory and implementation of MSMs for repeated measures data and draw upon a simple example to illustrate the basic ideas.","author":[{"family":"Hernán","given":"Miguel A"},{"family":"Brumback","given":"Babette A"},{"family":"Robins","given":"James M"}],"citation-key":"Hernan2002","container-title":"Statistics in medicine","event-place":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, 677 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. miguel_hernan@post.harvard.edu","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"number":"12","page":"1689-1709","publisher-place":"Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, 677 Huntington Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. miguel_hernan@post.harvard.edu","title":"Estimating the causal effect of zidovudine on CD4 count with a marginal structural model for repeated measures.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=12111906&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"21"},

The Markov chains point of view enables us to couple both deterministic layers as invertible neural networks and stochastic layers as Metropolis-Hasting layers, Langevin layers and variational autoencoders in a mathematically sound way. Besides layers with densities as Langevin layers, diffusion layers or variational autoencoders, also layers having no densities as deterministic layers or Metropolis-Hasting layers can be handled.

Correct specification of fixed and random effects is essential for practical data analysis. Simultaneous selection of variables in both longitudinal and survival components functions as a necessary safeguard against model misspecification. However, variable selection in such models has not been studied. No existing computational tools, to the best of our knowledge, have been made available to practitioners. In this article, we describe a penalized likelihood method with adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (ALASSO) penalty functions for simultaneous selection of fixed and random effects in joint models. To perform selection in variance components of random effects, we reparameterize the variance components using a Cholesky decomposition; in doing so, a penalty function of group shrinkage is introduced. To reduce the estimation bias resulted from penalization, we propose a two-stage selection procedure in which the magnitude of the bias is ameliorated in the second stage. The penalized likelihood is approximated by Gaussian quadrature and optimized by an EM algorithm. Simulation study showed excellent selection results in the first stage and small estimation biases in the second stage. To illustrate, we analyzed a longitudinally observed clinical marker and patient survival in a cohort of patients with heart failure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Zangdong"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Wanzhu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Sijian"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Haoda"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Zhangsheng"}],"citation-key":"heSimultaneousVariableSelection2015","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12221","ISSN":"1541-0420","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"178-187","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Simultaneous variable selection for joint models of longitudinal and survival outcomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.12221","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"hodgson:2012","abstract":"There is an increasing prevalence of drug-diagnostic combinations in oncology. This has placed diagnostic stakeholders directly into the complex benefit-risk, cost, value and uncertainty-driven development paradigm traditionally the preserve of the drug development community. In this review we focus on the delivery of the clinical data required to advance such drug-diagnostic combination development programmes and ultimately satisfy regulators and payors of the value of contemporaneous changes in diagnostic and treatment practice. Ideally all stakeholders would like to initially estimate, and ultimately specify, the comparative benefit-risk for a new treatment option with and without changing diagnostic practice. Hence, in an ideal world clinical trial design is focused on acquiring biomarker treatment interaction data. In this review we describe the key scientific and feasibility inputs required to design and deliver such trials and the drivers, advantages and disadvantages associated with departing from this model. We do not discuss the discovery of new biomarkers nor the analytical validation and marketing of diagnostic products. Following on from trial design we describe how subsequent success then depends upon the concepts that guide trial design being driven into the complex world of large, multinational clinical trial delivery. For every aspect of a traditional clinical drug trial such as supply, recruitment and adherence, there is a corresponding concept for the diagnostic element. In practice, this means that each patient's contribution to the decision making data-set is subject to double jeopardy (attrition on clinical outcome and biomarker status). Historically, this has led to significantly reduced power for detecting biomarker–treatment interactions, reduced decision making confidence and a waste of valuable human and financial resources. We describe recent practice changes and experience that have led to the successful delivery of such trials focusing on both pre- and on trial aspects. The former includes the pivotal role of tissue banks in accurate estimation of evaluability and prevalence for biomarker assays and the latter several practices designed to engage and incentivize key stakeholders particularly CRAs and pathologists. The result is that in the new world of developing personalized treatments for cancer patients the real-time acquisition and monitoring of biomarker data receives similar support to that traditionally reserved for clinical outcome data and far more patients contribute to the testing of personalized medicine hypotheses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Darren R."},{"family":"Wellings","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Harbron","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"hodgson:2012","collection-title":"Molecular Diagnostics & Personalised Medicine","container-title":"New Biotechnology","container-title-short":"New Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1016/j.nbt.2012.03.001","ISSN":"1871-6784","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,15]]},"page":"656-664","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Practical perspectives of personalized healthcare in oncology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871678412000441","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"holstein_2015","abstract":"The current bioassay development literature lacks the use of statistically robust methods for calculating the limit of detection of a given assay. Instead, researchers often employ simple methods that provide a rough estimate of the limit of detection, often without a measure of the confidence in the estimate. This scarcity of robust methods is likely due to a realistic preference for simple and accessible methods and to a lack of such methods that have reduced the concepts of limit of detection theory to practice for the specific application of bioassays. Here, we have developed a method for determining limits of detection for bioassays that is statistically robust and reduced to practice in a clear and accessible manner geared at researchers, not statisticians. This method utilizes a four-parameter logistic curve fit to translate signal intensity to analyte concentration, which is a curve that is commonly employed in quantitative bioassays. This method generates a 95% confidence interval of the limit of detection estimate to provide a measure of uncertainty and a means by which to compare the analytical sensitivities of different assays statistically. We have demonstrated this method using real data from the development of a paper-based influenza assay in our laboratory to illustrate the steps and features of the method. Using this method, assay developers can calculate statistically valid limits of detection and compare these values for different assays to determine when a change to the assay design results in a statistically significant improvement in analytical sensitivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Holstein","given":"Carly A."},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Maryclare"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Sampson","given":"Paul D."}],"citation-key":"holstein_2015","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

  {"id":"Holzinger2015","abstract":"Standard analysis methods for genome wide association studies (GWAS) are not robust to complex disease models, such as interactions between variables with small main effects. These types of effects likely contribute to the heritability of complex human traits. Machine learning methods that are capable of identifying interactions, such as Random Forests (RF), are an alternative analysis approach. One caveat to RF is that there is no standardized method of selecting variables so that false positives are reduced while retaining adequate power. To this end, we have developed a novel variable selection method called relative recurrency variable importance metric (r2VIM). This method incorporates recurrency and variance estimation to assist in optimal threshold selection. For this study, we specifically address how this method performs in data with almost completely epistatic effects (i.e. no marginal effects). Our results show that with appropriate parameter settings, r2VIM can identify interaction effects when the marginal effects are virtually nonexistent. It also outperforms logistic regression, which has essentially no power under this type of model when the number of potential features (genetic variants) is large.

  {"id":"hong:2024","abstract":"Purpose\nThe use of tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing in early-stage patients before surgery is limited mainly due to restricted tissue access and extended turnaround times. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical value of a tumor-naïve, methylation-based cell-free DNA assay in a large cohort of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nMethod\nWe analyzed pre-surgical plasma samples from 895 patients with EGFR and ALK-wild-type, clinical stage I or II NSCLC. The ctDNA status was evaluated for its prognostic significance in relation to tumor volume, metabolic activity, histology, histological subtypes, and clinical-to-pathological TNM upstaging.\nResults\nPre-surgical ctDNA detection was observed in 55 out of 414 (13%) patients with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and was associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) (2-year RFS 69% versus 91%; log-rank P<0.001), approaching that of clinical stage II LUAD. Pre-surgical ctDNA detection was not prognostic in patients with clinical stage II LUAD or non-LUAD. Within LUAD, tumor volume and positron emission tomography avidity interacted to predict pre-surgical ctDNA detection. Moreover, pre-surgical ctDNA detection was predictive of the post-surgical discovery of IASLC G3 tumors (P<0.001) and pathological TNM upstaging (P<0.001). Notably, pre-surgical ctDNA detection strongly correlated with higher PD-L1 expression in tumors (positive rates 28% vs. 55%, P<0.001), identifying a subgroup likely to benefit from anti-PD-(L)-1 therapies.\nConclusion\nThese findings support the integration of ctDNA testing into routine diagnostic workflows in early-stage NSCLC without the need of tumor tissue profiling. Furthermore, it is clinically useful in identifying high-risk patients who might benefit from innovative treatments, including neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Tae Hee"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Soohyun"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Abbosh","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Hung","given":"Tiffany"},{"family":"Bredno","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Xiaojin"},{"family":"Milenkova","given":"Tsveta"},{"family":"Horn","given":"Leora"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Joon Young"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Ho Yun"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Jong Ho"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Yong Soo"},{"family":"Shim","given":"Young Mog"},{"family":"Chai","given":"Shoujie"},{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Roychowdhury-Saha","given":"Manami"},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hong Kwan"},{"family":"Ahn","given":"Myung-Ju"}],"citation-key":"hong:2024","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","container-title-short":"Journal of Thoracic Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jtho.2024.07.002","ISSN":"1556-0864","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,9]]},"source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Clinical Utility of Tumor-Naïve Pre-surgical ctDNA Detection in Early-stage NSCLC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155608642400666X"},

In the clinical diagnosis of ovarian epithelial cancer, CA125 has become an important indicator of disease burden. To account for patient recurrence and death, a proper method is needed to integrate information from biomarkers and recurrence simultaneously. In the past 10 years, many methods have been proposed for joint modeling of longitudinal biomarkers and survival data, but few of them are applicable to longitudinal data and disease processes, including recurrence and death. In this article, we proposed a new joint frailty model based on functional principal component analysis for dynamic prediction of survival probabilities on the total time scale, which took recurrent history and longitudinal data into account simultaneously. The estimation of the joint frailty model is achieved by maximizing the penalized log-likelihood function. The simulation results demonstrated the advantages of our method in both discrimination and accuracy under different scenarios. To indicate the method's practicality, it is applied to an actual dataset of patients with ovarian epithelial cancer to predict survival dynamically using longitudinal data of biomarker CA125 and recurrent history data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Yizhou"},{"family":"Su","given":"Liwen"},{"family":"Song","given":"Siyi"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Fangrong"}],"citation-key":"hongDynamicPredictionDisease2021","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.8885","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","page":"2006-2023","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dynamic prediction of disease processes based on recurrent history and functional principal component analysis of longitudinal biomarkers: Application for ovarian epithelial cancer","title-short":"Dynamic prediction of disease processes based on recurrent history and functional principal component analysis of longitudinal biomarkers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8885","volume":"40"},

However, the presence of censored data such as survival time, often the main endpoint in cancer studies, has hampered the use of quantile regression techniques because of the incompleteness of data. With the advent of the precision medicine era and availability of high throughput data, quantile regression with high-dimensional predictors has attracted much attention and provided added insight compared to traditional regression approaches. This paper provides a practical guide for using quantile regression for right censored outcome data with covariates of low- or high-dimensionality. We frame our discussion using a dataset from the Boston Lung Cancer Survivor Cohort, a hospital-based prospective cohort study, with the goals of broadening the scope of cancer research, maximizing the utility of collected data, and offering useful statistical alternatives.

  {"id":"HoodVariationalAutoencoder","abstract":"The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) neatly synthesizes unsupervised deep learning and variational Bayesian methods into one sleek package. In Part I of this series, we introduced the theory and intuition behind the VAE, an exciting development in machine learning for combined generative modeling and inference—“machines that imagine and reason.”\nTo recap: VAEs put a probabilistic spin on the basic autoencoder paradigm—treating their inputs, hidden representations, and reconstructed outputs as probabilistic random variables within a directed graphical model. With this Bayesian perspective, the encoder becomes a variational inference network, mapping observed inputs to (approximate) posterior distributions over latent space, and the decoder becomes a generative network, capable of mapping arbitrary latent coordinates back to distributions over the original data space.\n\n\nThe beauty of this setup is that we can take a principled Bayesian approach toward building systems with a rich internal “mental model” of the observed world, all by training a single, cleverly-designed deep neural network.\nThese benefits derive from an enriched understanding of data as merely the tip of the iceberg—the observed result of an underlying causative probabilistic process.\nThe power of the resulting model is captured by Feynman’s famous chalkboard quote: “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” When trained on MNIST handwritten digits, our VAE model can parse the information spread thinly over the high-dimensional observed world of pixels, and condense the most meaningful features into a structured distribution over reduced latent dimensions.\nHaving recovered the latent manifold and assigned it a coordinate system, it becomes trivial to walk from one point to another along the manifold, creatively generating realistic digits all the while:\n\n\nIn this post, we’ll take a look under the hood at the math and technical details that allow us to optimize the VAE model we sketched in Part I.\nAlong the way, we’ll show how to implement a VAE in TensorFlow—a library for efficient numerical computation using data flow graphs, with key features like automatic differentiation and parallelizability (across clusters, CPUs, GPUs…and TPUs if you’re lucky). You can find (and tinker with!) the full implementation here, along with a couple pre-trained models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,2]]},"citation-key":"HoodVariationalAutoencoder","language":"en","title":"Under the Hood of the Variational Autoencoder (in Prose and Code)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/22/under-the-hood-of-the-variational-autoencoder-in-prose-and-code.html"},

Not only the number of observations, especially the number of measured variables (features) increases with ongoing digitization. Selecting the most appropriate features for predictive modeling is an important lever for the success of ML applications in business and research. Feature selection methods (FSM) that are independent of a certain ML algorithm - so-called filter methods - have been numerously suggested, but little guidance for researchers and quantitative modelers exists to choose appropriate approaches for typical ML problems. This review synthesizes the substantial literature on feature selection benchmarking and evaluates the performance of 58 methods in the widely used R environment. For concrete guidance, we consider four typical dataset scenarios that are challenging for ML models (noisy, redundant, imbalanced data and cases with more features than observations). Drawing on the experience of earlier benchmarks, which have considered much fewer FSMs, we compare the performance of the methods according to four criteria (predictive performance, number of relevant features selected, stability of the feature sets and runtime). We found methods relying on the random forest approach, the double input symmetrical relevance filter (DISR) and the joint impurity filter (JIM) were well-performing candidate methods for the given dataset scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Hopf","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Reifenrath","given":"Sascha"}],"citation-key":"hopfFilterMethodsFeature2021","container-title":"arXiv:2111.12140 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,23]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Filter Methods for Feature Selection in Supervised Machine Learning Applications -- Review and Benchmark","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12140"},

  {"id":"hougaard:1999","abstract":"Survival data stand out as a special statistical field. This paper tries to describe what survival data is and what makes it so special. Survival data concern times to some events. A key point is the successive observation of time, which on the one hand leads to some times not being observed so that all that is known is that they exceed some given times (censoring), and on the other hand implies that predictions regarding the future course should be conditional on the present status (truncation). In the simplest case, this condition is that the individual is alive. The successive conditioning makes the hazard function, which describes the probability of an event happening during a short interval given that the individual is alive today (or more generally able to experience the event), the most relevant concept. Standard distributions available (normal, log-normal, gamma, inverse Gaussian, and so forth) can account for censoring and truncation, but this is cumbersome. Besides, they fit badly because they are either symmetric or right skewed, but survival time distributions can easily be left-skewed positive variables. A few distributions satisfying these requirements are available, but often nonparametric methods are preferable as they account better conceptually for truncation and censoring and give a better fit. Finally, we compare the proportional hazards regression models with accelerated failure time models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Hougaard","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"hougaard:1999","container-title":"Biometrics","container-title-short":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00013.x","ISSN":"0006-341X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",3,1]]},"page":"13-22","source":"Silverchair","title":"Fundamentals of Survival Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00013.x","volume":"55"},

Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process.We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision.scMatch (Python code) and the FANTOM5 reference dataset are freely available to the research community here https://github.com/forrest-lab/scMatch.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hou","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Denisenko","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Forrest","given":"Alistair R R"}],"citation-key":"houScMatchSinglecellGene2019","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btz292","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"page":"4688-4695","source":"Silverchair","title":"scMatch: a single-cell gene expression profile annotation tool using reference datasets","title-short":"scMatch","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz292","volume":"35"},

Random effects in the longitudinal process are often used to model the survival times through a proportional hazards model, and this invokes an EM algorithm to search for the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs). Several intriguing issues are examined here, including the robustness of the MLEs against departure from the normal random effects assumption, and difficulties with the profile likelihood approach to provide reliable estimates for the standard error of the MLEs. We provide insights into the robustness property and suggest to overcome the difficulty of reliable estimates for the standard errors by using bootstrap procedures.

  {"id":"hsu:2018","abstract":"The population-based case-control study design has been widely used for studying the etiology of chronic diseases. It is well established that the Cox proportional hazards model can be adapted to the case-control study and hazard ratios can be estimated by (conditional) logistic regression model with time as either a matched set or a covariate (Prentice and Breslow, 1978). However, the baseline hazard function, a critical component in absolute risk assessment, is unidentifiable, because the ratio of cases and controls is controlled by the investigators and does not reflect the true disease incidence rate in the population. In this paper we propose a simple and innovative approach, which makes use of routinely collected family history information, to estimate the baseline hazard function for any logistic regression model that is fit to the risk factor data collected on cases and controls. We establish that the proposed baseline hazard function estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal and show via simulation that it performs well in finite samples. We illustrate the proposed method by a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer where the association of various risk factors is assessed and the family history information is used to estimate the baseline hazard function.","author":[{"family":"Hsu","given":"Li"},{"family":"Gorfine","given":"Malka"},{"family":"Zucker","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"hsu:2018","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","container-title-short":"J Am Stat Assoc","DOI":"10.1080/01621459.2017.1356315","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"522","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","page":"560-570","PMCID":"PMC6428431","PMID":"30906082","source":"PubMed","title":"On Estimation of the Hazard Function from Population-based Case-Control Studies","type":"article-journal","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"hsuStatisticalMethodsCohort2017","abstract":"Survival analysis is commonly used to evaluate factors associated with time to an event of interest (e.g., ESRD, cardiovascular disease, and mortality) among CKD populations. Time to the event of interest is typically observed only for some participants. Other participants have their event time censored because of the end of the study, death, withdrawal from the study, or some other competing event. Classic survival analysis methods, such as Cox proportional hazards regression, rely on the assumption that any censoring is independent of the event of interest. However, in most clinical settings, such as in CKD populations, this assumption is unlikely to be true. For example, participants whose follow-up time is censored because of health-related death likely would have had a shorter time to ESRD, had they not died. These types of competing events that cause dependent censoring are referred to as competing risks. Here, we first describe common circumstances in clinical renal research where competing risks operate and then review statistical approaches for dealing with competing risks. We compare two of the most popular analytical methods used in settings of competing risks: cause-specific hazards models and the Fine and Gray approach (subdistribution hazards models). We also discuss practical recommendations for analysis and interpretation of survival data that incorporate competing risks. To demonstrate each of the analytical tools, we use a study of fibroblast growth factor 23 and risks of mortality and ESRD in participants with CKD from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hsu","given":"Jesse Yenchih"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Xie","given":"Dawei"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Shou","given":"Haochang"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Amanda Hyre"},{"family":"Landis","given":"J.

Recent studies have introduced machine learning (ML)-based WebAssembly reverse engineering tools. Yet, the generalization of task-specific ML solutions remains challenging, because their effectiveness hinges on the availability of an ample supply of high-quality task-specific labeled data. Moreover, previous works overlook the high-level semantics present in source code and its documentation. Acknowledging the abundance of available source code with documentation, which can be compiled into WebAssembly, we propose to learn representations of them concurrently and harness their mutual relationships for effective WebAssembly reverse engineering. In this paper, we present WasmRev, the first multi-modal pre-trained language model for WebAssembly reverse engineering. WasmRev is pre-trained using self-supervised learning on a large-scale multi-modal corpus encompassing source code, code documentation and the compiled WebAssembly, without requiring labeled data. WasmRev incorporates three tailored multi-modal pre-training tasks to capture various characteristics of WebAssembly and cross-modal relationships. WasmRev is only trained once to produce general-purpose representations that can broadly support WebAssembly reverse engineering tasks through few-shot fine-tuning with much less labeled data, improving data efficiency. We fine-tune WasmRev onto three important reverse engineering tasks: type recovery, function purpose identification and WebAssembly summarization. Our results show that WasmRev pre-trained on the corpus of multi-modal samples establishes a robust foundation for these tasks, achieving high task accuracy and outperforming the state-of-the-art ML methods for WebAssembly reverse engineering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Hanxian"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jishen"}],"citation-key":"huang_2024","DOI":"10.1145/3650212.3652141","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,3]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Multi-modal Learning for WebAssembly Reverse Engineering","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03171"},

Though many models can predict differential survival from data, there is a strong need for sophisticated algorithms that can aggregate and filter relevant predictors from increasingly complex data inputs. In turn, these models should provide deeper insight into which types of data are most relevant to improve prognosis. Deep Learning-based neural networks offer a potential solution for both problems because they are highly flexible and account for data complexity in a non-linear fashion. In this study, we implement Deep Learning-based networks to determine how gene expression data predicts Cox regression survival in breast cancer. We accomplish this through an algorithm called SALMON (Survival Analysis Learning with Multi-Omics Neural Networks), which aggregates and simplifies gene expression data and cancer biomarkers to enable prognosis prediction. The results revealed improved performance when more omics data were used in model construction. Rather than use raw gene expression values as model inputs, we innovatively use eigengene modules from the result of gene co-expression network analysis. The corresponding high impact co-expression modules and other omics data are identified by feature selection technique, then examined by conducting enrichment analysis and exploiting biological functions, escalated the interpretation of input feature from gene level to co-expression modules level.

Three KM curves were identified from published randomized control trials: (a) curves diverged immediately; (b) intersected curves with statistical significance; and (c) intersected curves without statistical significance. We reconstructed individual patient data, and plotted 5 complementary plots (difference in survival probability and risk difference, difference in restricted mean survival time, landmark analyses, and hazard ratio over time), along with KM curve. Results. Entanglement and intersection of two KM curves would make the 5 complementary plots to fluctuate over time intuitively. Absolute effects were presented in the 3 plots of difference in survival probability, risk, and restricted mean survival time. Changed values from landmark analyses were used to inspect conditional treatment effect; the turning points could be identified for further landmark analysis. When proportional hazard assumption was not met, estimated hazard ratio from traditional Cox regression was not appropriate, and time-varying hazard ratios could be presented instead of an average and single value.

Now, as big data sets are available, two types of methods are needed to deal with the resulting curse of dimensionality including non informative factors which spoil the informative part relative to the target: on one hand, methods that reduce the dimension while maximizing the information left in the reduced data, and then applying classical stochastic models; on the other hand algorithms that apply directly to big data, i.e. artificial intelligence (AI or machine learning). Actually, those algorithms have a probabilistic interpretation. We present here several of the former methods. As for the latter methods, which comprise neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and more (see second edition, January 2017 of Hastie, Tibshirani et al. (2005) [1]), we present the neural networks approach. Neural networks are known to be efficient for prediction on big data. As we analyzed, using a classical stochastic model, risk factors for Alzheimer on a data set of around 5000 patients and p=17 factors, we were interested in comparing its prediction performance with the one of a neural network on this relatively small sample size data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Huber-Carol","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Gross","given":"Shulamith"},{"family":"Vonta","given":"Filia"}],"citation-key":"huber-carolRiskAnalysisSurvival2019","collection-title":"Data-Based Engineering Science and Technology","container-title":"Comptes Rendus Mécanique","container-title-short":"Comptes Rendus Mécanique","DOI":"10.1016/j.crme.2019.11.007","ISSN":"1631-0721","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"817-830","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Risk analysis: Survival data analysis vs. machine learning.

However, the performance of existing supervised methods is highly dependent on source data quality, and they often have limited accuracy to classify cell types that are missing in the source data. To overcome these limitations, we developed ItClust, a transfer learning algorithm that borrows idea from supervised cell type classification algorithms, but also leverages information in target data to ensure sensitivity in classifying cells that are only present in the target data. Through extensive evaluations using data from different species and tissues generated with diverse scRNA-seq protocols, we show that ItClust significantly improves clustering and cell type classification accuracy over popular unsupervised clustering and supervised cell type classification algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiangjie"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Lyu","given":"Yafei"},{"family":"Susztak","given":"Katalin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mingyao"}],"citation-key":"huIterativeTransferLearning2020","container-title":"Nature machine intelligence","container-title-short":"Nat Mach Intell","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-020-00233-7","ISSN":"2522-5839","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"page":"607-618","PMCID":"PMC8009055","PMID":"33817554","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Iterative transfer learning with neural network for clustering and cell type classification in single-cell RNA-seq analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009055/","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Huntley2012","abstract":"In decision problems, often, utilities and probabilities are hard to determine. In such cases, one can resort to so-called choice functions. They provide a means to determine which options in a particular set are optimal, and allow incomparability among any number of options. Applying choice functions in sequential decision problems can be highly non-trivial, as the usual properties of maximising expected utility may no longer be satisfied. In this paper, we study one of these properties: we revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of subgame perfectness in the context of decision trees, leading us to the concept of subtree perfectness, which basically says that the optimal solution of a decision tree should not depend on any larger tree it may be embedded in. In other words, subtree perfectness excludes counterfactual reasoning, and therefore may be desirable from some philosophical points of view. Subtree perfectness is also desirable from a practical point of view, because it admits efficient algorithms for solving decision trees, such as backward induction. The main contribution of this paper is a very simple non-technical criterion for determining whether any given choice function will satisfy subtree perfectness or not. We demonstrate the theorem and illustrate subtree perfectness, or the lack thereof, through numerous examples, for a wide variety of choice functions, where incomparability amongst strategies can be caused by imprecision in either probabilities or utilities. We find that almost no choice function, except for maximising expected utility, satisfies it in general. We also find that choice functions other than maximising expected utility can satisfy it, provided that we restrict either the structure of the tree, or the structure of the choice function.","author":[{"family":"Huntley","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Troffaes","given":"Matthias C M"}],"citation-key":"Huntley2012","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Library","title":"Identifying subtree perfectness in decision trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1154v1","volume":"math.ST"},

  {"id":"husainTumorFractionCorrelates2022","abstract":"PURPOSE\nProfiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is increasingly adopted in the management of solid tumors, concurrent with increased availability of more comprehensive ctDNA panels. However, variable ctDNA shed can result in variable assay sensitivity. We studied the relationship between ctDNA tumor fraction (TF) and detection of actionable alterations across cancer types.\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 23,482 liquid biopsies (LBx) submitted between September 2020 and October 2021 were sequenced using a hybrid capture panel that reports genomic alterations (GAs) and genomic biomarkers across 324 cancer-related genes. The primary end points were the prevalence of targetable GAs by cancer type and detection in relationship to ctDNA TF. Sensitivity of detection in LBx was assessed in 1,289 patients with available tissue results.\n\nRESULTS\n94% (n = 22,130) of LBx had detectable ctDNA, with a median TF of 2.2%. LBx profiling detected GAs in National Comprehensive Cancer Network category 1 genes in 37% of lung, 30% of prostate, 36% of breast, and 51% of colon cancer cases. Potential germline GAs flagged on clinical reports were detected in genes including BRCA1/2, PALB2, CHEK2, and ATM. Polyclonal mutations in genes associated with resistance such as AR, ESR1, RB1, and NF1 were detected. The sensitivity of LBx to detect driver alterations identified in tissue biopsy from the same patient ranged from 58% to 86% but was consistently at or near 100% in cases with TF ≥ 10%.\n\nCONCLUSION\nElevated ctDNA shed is associated with both high sensitivity and negative predictive value for detection of actionable GAs. The presence of elevated TF suggests adequate tumor profiling and may reduce the value of subsequent reflex to confirmatory tissue testing in patients with negative LBx results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Husain","given":"Hatim"},{"family":"Pavlick","given":"Dean C."},{"family":"Fendler","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Madison","given":"Russell W."},{"family":"Decker","given":"Brennan"},{"family":"Gjoerup","given":"Ole"},{"family":"Parachoniak","given":"Christine A."},{"family":"McLaughlin-Drubin","given":"Molly"},{"family":"Erlich","given":"Rachel L."},{"family":"Schrock","given":"Alexa B."},{"family":"Frampton","given":"Garrett M."},{"family":"Das Thakur","given":"Meghna"},{"family":"Oxnard","given":"Geoffrey R."},{"family":"Tukachinsky","given":"Hanna"}],"citation-key":"husainTumorFractionCorrelates2022","container-title":"JCO Precision Oncology","DOI":"10.1200/PO.22.00261","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"page":"e2200261","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"ascopubs.org (Atypon)","title":"Tumor Fraction Correlates With Detection of Actionable Variants Across > 23,000 Circulating Tumor DNA Samples","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.22.00261"},

Their apparent measures for predictive accuracy usually have overestimation biases (known as ‘optimism’) relative to the actual performances for external populations. Existing statistical evidence and guidelines suggest that three bootstrap-based bias correction methods are preferable in practice, namely Harrell’s bias correction and the .632 and .632+ estimators. Although Harrell’s method has been widely adopted in clinical studies, simulation-based evidence indicates that the .632+ estimator may perform better than the other two methods.

E1690 was an intriguing effort to corroborate E1684, and the differences between the outcomes of these trials have embroiled the field in controversy over the past several years. The analyses of E1684 and E1690 were carried out separately when the results were published, and there were no further analyses trying to perform a single analysis of the combined trials.\nMethod: In this paper, we consider such a joint analysis by carrying out a Bayesian analysis of these two trials, thus providing us with a consistent and coherent methodology for combining the results from these two trials.\nResults: The Bayesian analysis using power priors provided a more coherent flexible and potentially more accurate analysis than a separate analysis of these data or a frequentist analysis of these data. The methodology provides a consistent framework for carrying out a single unified analysis by combining data from two or more studies.\nConclusions: Such Bayesian analyses can be crucial in situations where the results from two theoretically identical trials yield somewhat conflicting or inconsistent results.","author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Joseph G"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ming-Hui"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Haitao"}],"citation-key":"ibrahimBayesianMethodsClinical2012","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Bayesian methods in clinical trials: a Bayesian analysis of ECOG trials E1684 and E1690","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"ibrahimBAYESIANMETHODSJOINT","abstract":"Vaccines have received a great deal of attention recently as potential therapies in cancer clinical trials. One reason for this is that they are much less toxic than chemotherapies and potentially less expensive. However, little is currently known about the biologic activity of vaccines and whether they are associated with clinical outcome. The antibody immune measures IgG and IgM have been proposed as potential useful measures in melanoma clinical trials because of their observed association with clinical outcome in pilot studies. To better understand the role of the IgG and IgM antibodies for a particular vaccine, we examine a case study in melanoma and investigate the association between clinical outcome and an individual’s antibody (IgG and IgM titers) history over time. The Cox proportional hazards model is used to study the relationship between the antibody titers as a time varying covariate and survival. We develop a Bayesian joint model for multivariate longitudinal and survival data and give its biologic motivation. Various scientiﬁc features of the model are discussed and interpreted. In addition, we present a model assessment tool called the multivariate L measure that allows us to formally compare diﬀerent models. A detailed analysis of a recent phase II melanoma vaccine clinical trial conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group is presented.","author":[{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Joseph G"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ming-Hui"},{"family":"Sinha","given":"Debajyoti"}],"citation-key":"ibrahimBAYESIANMETHODSJOINT","language":"en","page":"21","source":"Zotero","title":"BAYESIAN METHODS FOR JOINT MODELING OF LONGITUDINAL AND SURVIVAL DATA WITH APPLICATIONS TO CANCER VACCINE TRIALS","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"ikedaNextgenerationSequencingProstate2019","abstract":"Despite being one of the most common cancers, treatment options for prostate cancer are limited. Novel approaches for advanced disease are needed. We evaluated the relative rate of use of clinical-grade next generation sequencing (NGS) in prostate cancer, as well as genomic alterations identified and their potential actionability. Of 4864 patients from multiple institutions for whom NGS was ordered by physicians, only 67 (1.4%) had prostate cancer, representing 1/10 the ordering rate for lung cancer. Prostate cancers harbored 148 unique alterations affecting 63 distinct genes. No two patients had an identical molecular portfolio. The median number of characterized genomic alterations per patient was 3 (range, 1 to 9). Fifty-six of 67 patients (84%) had ≥ 1 potentially actionable alteration. TMPRSS2 fusions affected 28.4% of patients. Genomic aberrations were most frequently detected in TP53 (55.2% of patients), PTEN (29.9%), MYC (17.9%), PIK3CA (13.4%), APC (9.0%), BRCA2 (9.0%), CCND1 (9.0%), and RB1 genes (9.0%). The PI3K (52.2% of patients), WNT (13.5%), DNA repair (17.9%), cell cycle (19.4%), and MAPK (14.9%) machinery were commonly impacted. A minority of patients harbored BRAF, NTRK, ERBB2, or mismatch repair gene abnormalities, which are highly druggable in some cancers. Only ~ 10% of prostate cancer trials (clinicaltrials.gov, year 2017) applied a (non-hormone) biomarker before intervention. In conclusion, though use of clinical-grade NGS is relatively low and only a minority of trials deploy DNA-based biomarkers, many prostate cancer-associated molecular alterations may be pharmacologically tractable with genomcially targeted therapy or, in the case of mismatch repair anomalies, with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Ikeda","given":"Sadakatsu"},{"family":"Elkin","given":"Sheryl K."},{"family":"Tomson","given":"Brett N."},{"family":"Carter","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Kurzrock","given":"Razelle"}],"citation-key":"ikedaNextgenerationSequencingProstate2019","container-title":"Cancer Biology & Therapy","container-title-short":"Cancer Biol Ther","DOI":"10.1080/15384047.2018.1523849","ISSN":"1555-8576","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","page":"219-226","PMCID":"PMC6343723","PMID":"30339521","source":"PubMed","title":"Next-generation sequencing of prostate cancer: genomic and pathway alterations, potential actionability patterns, and relative rate of use of clinical-grade testing","title-short":"Next-generation sequencing of prostate cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"imotoResolutionCurseDimensionality2022","abstract":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can determine gene expression in numerous individual cells simultaneously, promoting progress in the biomedical sciences. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional with substantial technical noise, including dropouts. During analysis of scRNA-seq data, such noise engenders a statistical problem known as the curse of dimensionality (COD). Based on high-dimensional statistics, we herein formulate a noise reduction method, RECODE (resolution of the curse of dimensionality), for high-dimensional data with random sampling noise. We show that RECODE consistently resolves COD in relevant scRNA-seq data with unique molecular identifiers. RECODE does not involve dimension reduction and recovers expression values for all genes, including lowly expressed genes, realizing precise delineation of cell fate transitions and identification of rare cells with all gene information. Compared with representative imputation methods, RECODE employs different principles and exhibits superior overall performance in cell-clustering, expression value recovery, and single-cell–level analysis. The RECODE algorithm is parameter-free, data-driven, deterministic, and high-speed, and its applicability can be predicted based on the variance normalization performance. We propose RECODE as a powerful strategy for preprocessing noisy high-dimensional data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Imoto","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Tomonori"},{"family":"Escolar","given":"Emerson G."},{"family":"Yoshiwaki","given":"Michio"},{"family":"Kojima","given":"Yoji"},{"family":"Yabuta","given":"Yukihiro"},{"family":"Katou","given":"Yoshitaka"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Takuya"},{"family":"Hiraoka","given":"Yasuaki"},{"family":"Saitou","given":"Mitinori"}],"citation-key":"imotoResolutionCurseDimensionality2022","container-title":"Life Science Alliance","DOI":"10.26508/lsa.202201591","ISSN":"2575-1077","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 Imoto et al.. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/This article is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International, as described at https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).","PMID":"35944930","publisher":"Life Science Alliance","section":"Research Articles","source":"www.life-science-alliance.org","title":"Resolution of the curse of dimensionality in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.life-science-alliance.org/content/5/12/e202201591","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"infanteSampleSizePredictive","abstract":"Prediction models are increasingly developed and used in diagnostic and prognostic studies, where the use of machine learning (ML) methods is becoming more and more popular over traditional regression techniques. For survival outcomes the Cox proportional hazards model is generally used and it has been proven to achieve good prediction performances with few strong covariates. The possibility to improve the model performance by including nonlinearities, covariate interactions and time-varying effects while controlling for overfitting must be carefully considered during the model building phase. On the other hand, ML techniques are able to learn complexities from data at the cost of hyper-parameter tuning and interpretability. One aspect of special interest is the sample size needed for developing a survival prediction model. While there is guidance when using traditional statistical models, the same does not apply when using ML techniques. This work develops a time-to-event simulation framework to evaluate performances of Cox regression compared, among others, to tuned random survival forest, gradient boosting, and neural networks at varying sample sizes. Simulations were based on replications of subjects from publicly available databases, where event times were simulated according to a Cox model with nonlinearities on continuous variables and time-varying effects and on the SEER registry data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Infante","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Miceli","given":"Rosalba"},{"family":"Ambrogi","given":"Federico"}],"citation-key":"infanteSampleSizePredictive","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.9931","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

  {"id":"inoue:2005","abstract":"Sample size determination is among the most commonly encountered tasks in statistical practice. A broad range of frequentist and Bayesian methods for sample size determination can be described as choosing the smallest sample that is sufficient to achieve some set of goals. An example for the frequentist is seeking the smallest sample size that is sufficient to achieve a desired power at a specified significance level. An example for the Bayesian is seeking the smallest sample size necessary to obtain, in expectation, a desired rate of correct classification of the hypothesis as true or false. This article explores parallels between Bayesian and frequentist methods for determining sample size. We provide a simple but general and pragmatic framework for investigating the relationship between the two approaches, based on identifying mappings to connect the Bayesian and frequentist inputs necessary to obtain the same sample size. We illustrate this mapping with examples, highlighting a somewhat surprising “approximate functional correspondence” between power-based and information-based optimal sample sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"Lurdes Y.T"},{"family":"Berry","given":"Donald A"},{"family":"Parmigiani","given":"Giovanni"}],"citation-key":"inoue:2005","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1198/000313005X21069","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",2,1]]},"page":"79-87","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Relationship Between Bayesian and Frequentist Sample Size Determination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1198/000313005X21069","volume":"59"},

  {"id":"irizarry:2003","abstract":"In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.","author":[{"family":"Irizarry","given":"Rafael A."},{"family":"Hobbs","given":"Bridget"},{"family":"Collin","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Beazer-Barclay","given":"Yasmin D."},{"family":"Antonellis","given":"Kristen J."},{"family":"Scherf","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Speed","given":"Terence P."}],"citation-key":"irizarry:2003","container-title":"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)","container-title-short":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.249","ISSN":"1465-4644","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"249-264","PMID":"12925520","source":"PubMed","title":"Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

In this paper we introduce a variable selection method referred to as a rescaled spike and slab model. We study the importance of prior hierarchical specifications and draw connections to frequentist generalized ridge regression estimation. Specifically, we study the usefulness of continuous bimodal priors to model hypervariance parameters, and the effect scaling has on the posterior mean through its relationship to penalization. Several model selection strategies, some frequentist and some Bayesian in nature, are developed and studied theoretically. We demonstrate the importance of selective shrinkage for effective variable selection in terms of risk misclassification, and show this is achieved using the posterior from a rescaled spike and slab model. We also show how to verify a procedure's ability to reduce model uncertainty in finite samples using a specialized forward selection strategy.

  {"id":"james_2012","abstract":"Background Radiotherapy is an alternative to cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. In other disease sites, synchronous chemoradiotherapy has been associated with increased local control and improved survival, as compared with radiotherapy alone.\nMethods In this multicenter, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 360 patients with muscleinvasive bladder cancer to undergo radiotherapy with or without synchronous chemotherapy. The regimen consisted of fluorouracil (500 mg per square meter of bodysurface area per day) during fractions 1 to 5 and 16 to 20 of radiotherapy and mitomycin C (12 mg per square meter) on day 1. Patients were also randomly assigned to undergo either whole-bladder radiotherapy or modified-volume radiotherapy (in which the volume of bladder receiving full-dose radiotherapy was reduced) in a partial 2-by-2 factorial design (results not reported here). The primary end point was survival free of locoregional disease. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxic effects.\nResults At 2 years, rates of locoregional disease–free survival were 67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59 to 74) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 54% (95% CI, 46 to 62) in the radiotherapy group. With a median follow-up of 69.9 months, the hazard ratio in the chemoradiotherapy group was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.96; P = 0.03). Five-year rates of overall survival were 48% (95% CI, 40 to 55) in the chemoradiotherapy group and 35% (95% CI, 28 to 43) in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09; P = 0.16). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were slightly more common in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group during treatment (36.0% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.07) but not during follow-up (8.3% vs. 15.7%, P = 0.07).

Among 10 machine-learning classifiers trained on the same samples and independently validated, when evaluated at 98% specificity, those using whole-genome (WG) methylation, single nucleotide variants with paired white blood cell background removal, and combined scores from classifiers evaluated in this study show the highest cancer signal detection sensitivities. Compared with clinical stage and tumor type, cTAF is a more significant predictor of classifier performance and may more closely reflect tumor biology. Clinical LODs mirror relative sensitivities for all approaches. The WG methylation feature best predicts cancer signal origin.

Tumor response to treatments is governed by an interaction of cancer cell intrinsic factors with external influences of the tumor microenvironment.

In cancer therapy it enables an effective characterization of the complete heterogeneity within the tumor. A governing challenge in cancer single cell analysis is cell annotation, the assignment of a particular cell type or a cell state to each sequenced cell.

Automatic characterization of tumor cells would expedite neoantigen prediction, automatic characterization of tumor cell states, it would greatly facilitate cancer biomarker discovery.

  {"id":"jenkinsContinualUpdatingMonitoring2021","abstract":"Abstract \n            Clinical prediction models (CPMs) have become fundamental for risk stratification across healthcare. The CPM pipeline (development, validation, deployment, and impact assessment) is commonly viewed as a one-time activity, with model updating rarely considered and done in a somewhat ad hoc manner. This fails to address the fact that the performance of a CPM worsens over time as natural changes in populations and care pathways occur. CPMs need constant surveillance to maintain adequate predictive performance. Rather than reactively updating a developed CPM once evidence of deteriorated performance accumulates, it is possible to proactively adapt CPMs whenever new data becomes available. Approaches for validation then need to be changed accordingly, making validation a continuous rather than a discrete effort. As such, “living” (dynamic) CPMs represent a paradigm shift, where the analytical methods dynamically generate updated versions of a model through time; one then needs to validate the system rather than each subsequent model revision.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Jenkins","given":"David A."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Sperrin","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Riley","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Debray","given":"Thomas P.

  {"id":"jenkinsMechanismsResistanceImmune2018","abstract":"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown unprecedented clinical activity in several types of cancer and are rapidly transforming the practice of medical oncology. Whereas cytotoxic chemotherapy and small molecule inhibitors (‘targeted therapies’) largely act on cancer cells directly, immune checkpoint inhibitors reinvigorate anti-tumour immune responses by disrupting co-inhibitory T-cell signalling. While resistance routinely develops in patients treated with conventional cancer therapies and targeted therapies, durable responses suggestive of long-lasting immunologic memory are commonly seen in large subsets of patients treated with ICI. However, initial response appears to be a binary event, with most non-responders to single-agent ICI therapy progressing at a rate consistent with the natural history of disease. In addition, late relapses are now emerging with longer follow-up of clinical trial populations, suggesting the emergence of acquired resistance. As robust biomarkers to predict clinical response and/or resistance remain elusive, the mechanisms underlying innate (primary) and acquired (secondary) resistance are largely inferred from pre-clinical studies and correlative clinical data. Improved understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of ICI response (and resistance) may not only identify novel predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers, but also ultimately guide optimal combination/sequencing of ICI therapy in the clinic. Here we review the emerging clinical and pre-clinical data identifying novel mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Russell W."},{"family":"Barbie","given":"David A."},{"family":"Flaherty","given":"Keith T."}],"citation-key":"jenkinsMechanismsResistanceImmune2018","container-title":"British Journal of Cancer","container-title-short":"Br J Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/bjc.2017.434","ISSN":"1532-1827","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"9-16","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2017434","volume":"118"},

  {"id":"Jha:2018b","abstract":"Melorheostosis (MEL) is a rare disease of high bone mass with patchy skeletal distribution affecting the long bones. We recently reported somatic mosaic mutations in MAP2K1 in 8 of 15 patients with the disease. The unique anatomic distribution of melorheostosis is of great interest. The disease remains limited to medial or lateral side of the extremity with proximo-distal progression. This pattern of distribution has historically been attributed to sclerotomes (area of bone which is innervated by a single spinal nerve level). In a further analysis of our study on MEL, 30 recruited patients underwent whole body CT scans to characterize the anatomic distribution of the disease. Two radiologists independently reviewed these scans and compared it to the proposed map of sclerotomes. We found that the disease distribution conformed to the distribution of a single sclerotome in only 5 patients (17%). In another 12 patients, the lesions spanned parts of contiguous sclerotomes but did not involve the entire extent of the sclerotomes. Our findings raise concerns about the sclerotomal hypothesis being the definitive explanation for the pattern of anatomic distribution in MEL. We believe that the disease distribution can be explained by clonal proliferation of a mutated skeletal progenitor cell along the limb axis. Studies in mice models on clonal proliferation in limb buds mimic the patterns seen in melorheostosis. We also support this hypothesis by the dorso-ventral confinement of melorheostotic lesion in a patient with low allele frequency of MAP2K1-positive osteoblasts and low skeletal burden of the disease. This suggests that the mutation occurred after the formation of dorso-ventral plane. Further studies on limb development are needed to better understand the etiology, pathophysiology and pattern of disease distribution in all patients with MEL.","author":[{"family":"Jha","given":"Smita"},{"family":"Laucis","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Malayeri","given":"Ashkan"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Papadakis","given":"Georgios Z."},{"family":"Karantanas","given":"Apostolos"},{"family":"Torres","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"Jha:2018b","container-title":"Bone","DOI":"10.1016/j.bone.2018.09.005","ISSN":"8756-3282","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"page":"31 - 36","PMID":"30218789","publisher":"Elsevier BV","title":"CT analysis of anatomical distribution of melorheostosis challenges the sclerotome hypothesis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328218303430","volume":"117"},

  {"id":"jiang_2021","abstract":"Clinical studies with time to event endpoints typically report the median follow-up (i.e., censoring) time for the subjects in the trial, alongside the median time to event. The reason for this is to provide information about the opportunity for subjects in the study to experience the event of interest (Betensky, 2015 [1]). The median follow-up time is often calculated from the Kaplan–Meier estimate for time to censoring. In most clinical studies, the censoring time is a composite measure, defined as the minimum of time to drop-out from the study and time to administrative end of study. The time to drop-out component may or may not be observed; it is observed only if drop-out occurs before the event and the end of the study. However, the time to end of study is observed for each subject, as it is the time from entry to the study to the calendar date that is administratively set as the end of the study. It is known even for subjects who have the event prior to the end of the study. This decomposition of the censoring time into a time that is itself potentially censored and a time that is fully observed raises the interesting question of whether estimation of the censoring distribution could be improved through a decoupling of these times. We demonstrate in simulations that consideration of censoring in this way yields reduced variability under some circumstances and should be used in practice. We illustrate these concepts through application to a meningioma study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Shu"},{"family":"Swanson","given":"David"},{"family":"Betensky","given":"Rebecca A."}],"citation-key":"jiang_2021","container-title":"Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications","container-title-short":"Contemporary Clinical Trials Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100842","ISSN":"2451-8654","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"page":"100842","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Estimation of the censoring distribution in clinical trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451865421001423","volume":"23"},

In addition, ImmCluster provides cell clustering using seven reference-based and four marker gene-based computational methods, and the ensemble method was developed to provide consistent cell clustering than individual methods. Five major analytic modules were provided for interactively exploring the annotations of immune cells, including clustering and annotating immune cell clusters, gene expression of markers, functional assignment in cancer hallmarks, cell states and immune pathways, cell–cell communications and the corresponding ligand–receptor interactions, as well as online tools. ImmCluster generates diverse plots and tables, enabling users to identify significant associations in immune cell clusters simultaneously.

  {"id":"jiaNovelMethodSubgroup2020","abstract":"A lack of understanding of human biology creates a hurdle for the development of precision medicines. To overcome this hurdle we need to better understand the potential synergy between a given investigational treatment (vs. placebo or active control) and various demographic or genetic factors, disease history and severity, etc., with the goal of identifying those patients at increased “risk” of exhibiting clinically meaningful treatment benefit. For this reason, we propose the VG method, which combines the idea of an individual treatment effect (ITE) from Virtual Twins with the unbiased variable selection and cutoff value determination algorithm from GUIDE.

Specifically, we prompt Codex to solve the GeneTuring tests with NCBI Web APIs by in-context learning and an augmented decoding algorithm that can detect and execute API calls.Experimental results show that GeneGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight tasks in the GeneTuring benchmark with an average score of 0.83, largely surpassing retrieval-augmented LLMs such as the new Bing (0.44), biomedical LLMs such as BioMedLM (0.08) and BioGPT (0.04), as well as GPT-3 (0.16) and ChatGPT (0.12). Our further analyses suggest that: First, API demonstrations have good cross-task generalizability and are more useful than documentations for in-context learning; second, GeneGPT can generalize to longer chains of API calls and answer multi-hop questions in GeneHop, a novel dataset introduced in this work; finally, different types of errors are enriched in different tasks, providing valuable insights for future improvements.The GeneGPT code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ncbi/GeneGPT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Qiao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qingyu"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhiyong"}],"citation-key":"jin_2024","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btae075","ISSN":"1367-4811","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,1]]},"page":"btae075","source":"Silverchair","title":"GeneGPT: augmenting large language models with domain tools for improved access to biomedical information","title-short":"GeneGPT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae075","volume":"40"},
  {"id":"jiScAnnotateAutomatedCell2022","abstract":"Motivation Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to investigate a genome at the cellular level with unprecedented resolution. An organism consists of a heterogeneous collection of cell types, each of which plays a distinct role in various biological processes. Hence, the first step of scRNA-seq data analysis is often to distinguish cell types so they can be investigated separately. Researchers have recently developed several automated cell type annotation tools, requiring neither biological knowledge nor subjective human decisions. Dropout is a crucial characteristic of scRNA-seq data widely used in differential expression analysis. However, dropout information is not explicitly used by any current cell annotation method. Fully utilizing dropout information for cell type annotation motivated this work.\nResults We present scAnnotate, a cell annotation tool that fully utilizes dropout information. We model every gene’s marginal distribution using a mixture model, which describes both the dropout proportion and the distribution of the non-dropout expression levels. Then, using an ensemble machine learning approach, we combine the mixture models of all genes into a single model for cell-type annotation. This combining approach can avoid estimating numerous parameters in the high-dimensional joint distribution of all genes. Using fourteen real scRNA-seq datasets, we demonstrate that scAnnotate is competitive against nine existing annotation methods. Furthermore, because of its distinct modelling strategy, scAnnotate’s misclassified cells are very different from competitor methods. This suggests using scAnnotate together with other methods could further improve annotation accuracy.\nAvailability We implemented scAnnotate as an R package and made it publicly available from CRAN.\nContact Xuekui Zhang: xuekui{at}uvic.ca and Li Xing: li.xing{at}math.usask.ca","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ji","given":"Xiangling"},{"family":"Tsao","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Kailun"},{"family":"Tsao","given":"Min"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuekui"}],"citation-key":"jiScAnnotateAutomatedCell2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.02.19.481159","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,7]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Methods are increasingly needed across datasets and species to (i) remove systematic biases, (ii) model multiple datasets with ambiguous labels and (iii) classify cells and map cell type labels. However, most methods only address one of these problems on broad cell types or simulated data using a single model type. It is also important to address higher-resolution cellular subtypes, subtype labels from multiple datasets, models trained on multiple datasets simultaneously and generalizability beyond a single model type.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We developed a species- and dataset-independent transfer learning framework (LAmbDA) to train models on multiple datasets (even from different species) and applied our framework on simulated, pancreas and brain scRNA-seq experiments. These models mapped corresponding cell types between datasets with inconsistent cell subtype labels while simultaneously reducing batch effects. We achieved high accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes (weighted accuracy simulated 1 datasets: 90%; simulated 2 datasets: 94%; pancreas datasets: 88% and brain datasets: 66%) using LAmbDA Feedforward 1 Layer Neural Network with bagging. This method achieved higher weighted accuracy in labeling cellular subtypes than two other state-of-the-art methods, scmap and CaSTLe in brain (66% versus 60% and 32%). Furthermore, it achieved better performance in correctly predicting ambiguous cellular subtype labels across datasets in 88% of test cases compared with CaSTLe (63%), scmap (50%) and MetaNeighbor (50%).

To address this need, we present Tisane, a mixed-initiative system for authoring generalized linear models with and without mixed-effects. Tisane introduces a study design specification language for expressing and asking questions about relationships between variables. Tisane contributes an interactive compilation process that represents relationships in a graph, infers candidate statistical models, and asks follow-up questions to disambiguate user queries to construct a valid model.

  {"id":"kalesinskas_2022","abstract":"A major limitation of gene expression biomarker studies is that they are not reproducible as they simply do not generalize to larger, real-world, heterogeneous populations. Frequentist multi-cohort gene expression meta-analysis has been frequently used as a solution to this problem to identify biomarkers that are truly differentially expressed. However, the frequentist meta-analysis framework has its limitations–it needs at least 4–5 datasets with hundreds of samples, is prone to confounding from outliers and relies on multiple-hypothesis corrected p-values.

  {"id":"kalesinskasIncreasingReproducibilityRobustness2022","abstract":"A major limitation of gene expression biomarker studies is that they are not reproducible as they simply do not generalize to larger, real-world, heterogeneous populations. Frequentist multi-cohort gene expression meta-analysis has been frequently used as a solution to this problem to identify biomarkers that are truly differentially expressed. However, the frequentist meta-analysis framework has its limitations–it needs at least 4–5 datasets with hundreds of samples, is prone to confounding from outliers and relies on multiple-hypothesis corrected p-values.

  {"id":"kamran_2023","abstract":"There is an urgent need for biomarkers of radiation response in organ-sparing therapies. Bladder preservation with trimodality therapy (TMT), consisting of transurethral tumor resection followed by chemoradiation, is an alternative to radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but molecular determinants of response are poorly understood.We characterized genomic and transcriptomic features correlated with long-term response in a single institution cohort of patients with MIBC homogeneously treated with TMT. Pretreatment tumors from 76 patients with MIBC underwent whole-exome sequencing; 67 underwent matched transcriptomic profiling. Molecular features were correlated with clinical outcomes including modified bladder-intact event-free survival (mBI-EFS), a composite endpoint that reflects long-term cancer control with bladder preservation.With a median follow-up of 74.6 months in alive patients, 37 patients had favorable long-term response to TMT while 39 had unfavorable long-term response. Tumor mutational burden was not associated with outcomes after TMT. DNA damage response gene alterations were associated with improved locoregional control and mBI-EFS. Of these alterations, somatic ERCC2 mutations stood out as significantly associated with favorable long-term outcomes; patients with ERCC2 mutations had significantly improved mBI-EFS [HR, 0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06–0.37; P = 0.030] and improved BI-EFS, an endpoint that includes all-cause mortality (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15–0.68; P = 0.044). ERCC2 mutant bladder cancer cell lines were significantly more sensitive to concurrent cisplatin and radiation treatment in vitro than isogenic ERCC2 wild-type cells.Our data identify ERCC2 mutation as a candidate biomarker associated with sensitivity and long-term response to chemoradiation in MIBC. These findings warrant validation in independent cohorts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kamran","given":"Sophia C."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yuzhen"},{"family":"Otani","given":"Keisuke"},{"family":"Drumm","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Otani","given":"Yukako"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shulin"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Chin-Lee"},{"family":"Feldman","given":"Adam S."},{"family":"Wszolek","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Saylor","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Lennerz","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Van Allen","given":"Eliezer"},{"family":"Willers","given":"Henning"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Theodore S."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Davicioni","given":"Elai"},{"family":"Gibb","given":"Ewan A."},{"family":"Shipley","given":"William U."},{"family":"Mouw","given":"Kent W."},{"family":"Efstathiou","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Miyamoto","given":"David T."}],"citation-key":"kamran_2023","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clinical Cancer Research","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0792","ISSN":"1078-0432","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,15]]},"page":"5116-5127","source":"Silverchair","title":"Genomic Tumor Correlates of Clinical Outcomes Following Organ-Sparing Chemoradiation Therapy for Bladder Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-0792","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"kaplan:1958","abstract":"In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0≤t 1ǐ≤t 2ǐ≤ … ≤t N ǐ. Then P(t)= II. [(N – r)/(N – r + 1)], where r assumes those values for which tr ≤t and for which tr ǐ measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors. * Prepared while the authors were at Bell Telephone Laboratories and Johns Hopkins University respectively.

  {"id":"karpievitchIntrospectiveComparisonRandom2009","abstract":"Many mass spectrometry-based studies, as well as other biological experiments produce cluster-correlated data. Failure to account for correlation among observations may result in a classification algorithm overfitting the training data and producing overoptimistic estimated error rates and may make subsequent classifications unreliable. Current common practice for dealing with replicated data is to average each subject replicate sample set, reducing the dataset size and incurring loss of information. In this manuscript we compare three approaches to dealing with cluster-correlated data: unmodified Breiman's Random Forest (URF), forest grown using subject-level averages (SLA), and RF++ with subject-level bootstrapping (SLB). RF++, a novel Random Forest-based algorithm implemented in C++, handles cluster-correlated data through a modification of the original resampling algorithm and accommodates subject-level classification. Subject-level bootstrapping is an alternative sampling method that obviates the need to average or otherwise reduce each set of replicates to a single independent sample. Our experiments show nearly identical median classification and variable selection accuracy for SLB forests and URF forests when applied to both simulated and real datasets. However, the run-time estimated error rate was severely underestimated for URF forests. Predictably, SLA forests were found to be more severely affected by the reduction in sample size which led to poorer classification and variable selection accuracy. Perhaps most importantly our results suggest that it is reasonable to utilize URF for the analysis of cluster-correlated data. Two caveats should be noted: first, correct classification error rates must be obtained using a separate test dataset, and second, an additional post-processing step is required to obtain subject-level classifications. RF++ is shown to be an effective alternative for classifying both clustered and non-clustered data. Source code and stand-alone compiled versions of command-line and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) versions of RF++ for Windows and Linux as well as a user manual (Supplementary File S2) are available for download at: http://sourceforge.org/projects/rfpp/ under the GNU public license.","author":[{"family":"Karpievitch","given":"Yuliya V"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Elizabeth G"},{"family":"Leclerc","given":"Anthony P"},{"family":"Dabney","given":"Alan R"},{"family":"Almeida","given":"Jonas S"}],"citation-key":"karpievitchIntrospectiveComparisonRandom2009","container-title":"PLoS One","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"number":"9","page":"e7087","title":"An introspective comparison of random forest-based classifiers for the analysis of cluster-correlated data by way of RF++.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0007087","volume":"4"},

Advancing tools to integrate multi-omics data, we develop functional inference of gene regulation (FigR), a framework to computationally pair scATAC-seq with scRNA-seq cells, connect distal cis-regulatory elements to genes, and infer gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) to identify candidate transcription factor (TF) regulators. Utilizing these paired multi-omics data, we define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) of immune stimulation and find that cells alter chromatin accessibility and gene expression at timescales of minutes. Construction of the stimulation GRN elucidates TF activity at disease-associated DORCs.

  {"id":"katzmanDeepSurvPersonalizedTreatment2018","abstract":"Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations. We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients. The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Katzman","given":"Jared"},{"family":"Shaham","given":"Uri"},{"family":"Bates","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Cloninger","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Kluger","given":"Yuval"}],"citation-key":"katzmanDeepSurvPersonalizedTreatment2018","container-title":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","container-title-short":"BMC Med Res Methodol","DOI":"10.1186/s12874-018-0482-1","ISSN":"1471-2288","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"page":"24","source":"arXiv.org","title":"DeepSurv: Personalized Treatment Recommender System Using A Cox Proportional Hazards Deep Neural Network","title-short":"DeepSurv","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00931","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"kawaguchiScalableAlgorithmsLarge2021","abstract":"This article develops two orthogonal contributions to scalable sparse regression for competing risks time-to-event data. First, we study and accelerate the broken adaptive ridge method (BAR), a surrogate l0 -based iteratively reweighted l2 -penalization algorithm that achieves sparsity in its limit, in the context of the Fine-Gray (1999) proportional subdistributional hazards (PSH) model. In particular, we derive a new algorithm for BAR regression, named cycBAR, that performs cyclic updates of each coordinate using an explicit thresholding formula. The new cycBAR algorithm effectively avoids fitting multiple reweighted l2 -penalizations and thus yields impressive speedups over the original BAR algorithm. Second, we address a pivotal computational issue related to fitting the PSH model. Specifically, the cost of computing the log-pseudo likelihood and its derivatives grows at the rate of O(n2) with the sample size n in current implementations. We propose a novel forward-backward scan algorithm that reduces the computation costs to O(n). The proposed method applies to both unpenalized and penalized estimation for the PSH model and has exhibited drastic speedups over current implementations. Finally, combining the two algorithms can yield > 1000 fold speedups over the original BAR algorithm. Illustrations of the impressive scalability of our proposed algorithm for large competing risks data are given using both simulations and data from the United States Renal Data System.

The implementation of this framework, however, comes with a multitude of practical challenges including posterior approximation via Markov chain Monte Carlo and numerical integration. We present a Variational Bayesian Inference approach to BMA as a viable alternative to the standard solutions which avoids many of the aforementioned pitfalls. The proposed method is “black box” in the sense that it can be readily applied to many models with little to no model-specific derivation.

While the drawbacks of\n                p\n                -values have been detailed in endless venues, for clinical research, only a few attractive alternatives have been proposed to replace\n                p\n                -values and NHST. Bayesian methods are one of them, and they are gaining increasing attention in medical research, as some of their advantages include the description of model parameters in terms of probability, as well as the incorporation of prior information in contrast to the frequentist framework. While Bayesian methods are not the only remedy to the situation, there is an increasing agreement that they are an essential way to avoid common misconceptions and false interpretation of study results. The requirements necessary for applying Bayesian statistics have transitioned from detailed programming knowledge into simple point-and-click programs like JASP. Still, the multitude of Bayesian significance and effect measures which contrast the gold standard of significance in medical research, the\n                p\n                -value, causes a lack of agreement on which measure to report.\n              \n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Therefore, in this paper, we conduct an extensive simulation study to compare common Bayesian significance and effect measures which can be obtained from a posterior distribution. In it, we analyse the behaviour of these measures for one of the most important statistical procedures in medical research and in particular clinical trials, the two-sample Student’s (and Welch’s) t-test.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The results show that some measures cannot state evidence for both the null and the alternative. While the different indices behave similarly regarding increasing sample size and noise, the prior modelling influences the obtained results and extreme priors allow for cherry-picking similar to p-hacking in the frequentist paradigm. The indices behave quite differently regarding their ability to control the type I error rates and regarding their ability to detect an existing effect.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Based on the results, two of the commonly used indices can be recommended for more widespread use in clinical and biomedical research, as they improve the type I error control compared to the classic two-sample t-test and enjoy multiple other desirable properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelter","given":"Riko"}],"citation-key":"kelterAnalysisBayesianPosterior2020","container-title":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","container-title-short":"BMC Med Res Methodol","DOI":"10.1186/s12874-020-00968-2","ISSN":"1471-2288","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","page":"88","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analysis of Bayesian posterior significance and effect size indices for the two-sample t-test to support reproducible medical research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-00968-2","volume":"20"},

Although significance testing and p-values are often presented as prescriptive procedures, they came about through a process of refinement and extension to other disciplines. Ronald A. Fisher and his contemporaries formalized these methods in the early twentieth century and Fisher’s 1925 Statistical Methods for Research Workers brought the techniques to experimentalists in a variety of disciplines. Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p < 0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae. Incorporating history enables students, practitioners, and statisticians to treat the discipline as an ongoing endeavor, crafted by fallible humans, and provides a deeper understanding of the subject and its consequences for science and society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kennedy-Shaffer","given":"Lee"}],"citation-key":"kennedy-shaffer0505Using2019","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2018.1537891","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"number":"sup1","page":"82-90","PMID":"31413381","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Before p < 0.05 to Beyond p < 0.05: Using History to Contextualize p-Values and Significance Testing","title-short":"Before p < 0.05 to Beyond p < 0.05","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1537891","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"khaderCorrelationEarlyEndpoints2020","abstract":"Background In clinical trials that assess novel therapeutic agents in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), early endpoints (e.g. progression-free survival [PFS] and objective response rate) are often evaluated as indicators of biological drug activity, and are used as surrogate endpoints for overall survival (OS). Compiling trial-level data could help to develop a predictive framework to ascertain correlation trends between treatment effects for early (e.g. odds ratio [OR] for PFS at 6 months) and late endpoints (e.g. hazard ratio [HR] OS).\nMethods A dataset was compiled, which included 81 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs; Phase II–IV) of NSCLC (Stages I–IV), with 35 drugs and 156 observations. The dataset was collected from multiple source databases, including Citeline, TrialTrove, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed. We applied random-effects meta-analysis to correlate a variety of treatment effects for early endpoints with HR OS. We performed meta-regression analyses across different data-strata, stratified by the mechanism of action (MoA) of the investigational product (programmed death protein-1/programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-1/PD-L1], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and DNA damage response).\nResults Low (Spearman’s rho 0.3–<0.5) to moderate (rho 0.5–<0.7) correlations were observed between HR OS and (1) HR PFS, (2) OR PFS 4 months, and (3) OR PFS 6 months for PD-1/PD-L1 trials, EGFR trials, and all trials combined (Random-effects meta-regression; P<0.05). Similar correlations were observed between each of the early endpoint treatment effects and HR OS. For example, the moderate correlation observed between OR PFS 4 months and HR OS (rho-0.579; 95% confidence interval [CI]-0.800,-0.274; meta-regression R2= 72.5%) was similar to that between OR PFS 6 months and HR OS (rho-0.633; 95% CI-0.802, -0.383; R2=86.1%) for PD-1/PD-L1 trials. Note, the reported rho values are negative as a HR<1, and an OR>1, indicate benefit with the investigational product.\nConclusions Using a comprehensive summary data set in the NSCLC space, we observed low-to-moderate correlations between treatment effects for early endpoints and HR OS across RCTs of agents with different MoAs, including trials of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. Exploration of additional endpoints, beyond RECIST, is required to identify other early indicators of efficacy that might predict HR OS. By incorporating additional trial-level parameters and building composite biomarkers using machine intelligence methods, in collaboration with innovative trial design efforts, we envisage to improve the prediction of HR OS from early endpoints.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Khader","given":"Shameer"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Youyi"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Kirsty"},{"family":"Neelufer","given":"Imran Khan Anwer"},{"family":"Nampally","given":"Sreenath"},{"family":"Prokop","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Hutchison","given":"Emmette"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Jiabu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Sabin","given":"Antony"},{"family":"Weatherall","given":"James"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Iacona","given":"Renee"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Faisal"},{"family":"Mukhopadhyay","given":"Pralay"}],"citation-key":"khaderCorrelationEarlyEndpoints2020","container-title":"Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1136/jitc-2020-SITC2020.0663","ISSN":"2051-1426","issue":"Suppl 3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

We demonstrate improved prognostic performance of the multi-modal approach over single modality predictors in a cohort of 2552 head and neck cancer patients, particularly for cancer specific survival, where our approach achieves 2-year AUROC of 0.774 and C-index of 0.788.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Sejin"},{"family":"Kazmierski","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Haibe-Kains","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"kimDeepCRMTLRMultimodal2021","collection-title":"Proceedings of machine learning research","container-title":"Proceedings of AAAI spring symposium on survival prediction - algorithms, challenges, and applications 2021","editor":[{"family":"Greiner","given":"Russell"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Neeraj"},{"family":"Gerds","given":"Thomas Alexander"},{"family":"Schaar","given":"Mihaela","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,22],["2021",3,24]]},"page":"223–231","publisher":"PMLR","title":"Deep-CR MTLR: a multi-modal approach for cancer survival prediction with competing risks","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v146/kim21a.html","volume":"146"},

Such parameterizations can be trivially parallelized and have variance that is inversely proportional to the minibatch size, generally leading to much faster convergence. Additionally, we explore a connection with dropout: Gaussian dropout objectives correspond to SGVB with local reparameterization, a scale-invariant prior and proportionally fixed posterior variance.

In the presence of competing risks, the cumulative incidence function proposed by Kalbfleisch and Prentice is often used to construct parameter estimates. There are different approaches to modeling the cumulative incidence function directly; one is Fine and Gray’s method incorporating a proportional subdistribution hazards model. There are several computational approaches to estimating the Fine-Gray model; the two most popular are the weighted estimating equations approach (used in the original paper by Fine and Gray) and an approach (Geskus 2011) that explicitly augments the original data set with weighted pseudo observations that effectively keep a subject in the risk set for the failure type of primary interest after they experience a competing risk event. In the latter approach the augmented data are then analyzed using standard Cox regression software. The augmenting process is available through the PSHREG macro in SAS (Kohl and Heinze, 2012). Both approaches are computationally intensive with large data sets. We investigated the computing time required to run standard Cox regression and the PSHREG macro for the pseudo observation approach in order to obtain parameter estimates on test data sets of different sizes in SAS.","author":[{"family":"Kirby","given":"Katharine A"},{"family":"Barnes","given":"Deborah E"},{"family":"Boscardin","given":"W John"}],"citation-key":"kirbyCompetingRisksRegression","language":"en","page":"4","source":"Zotero","title":"Competing risks regression: Big Data issues from modest sample sizes","type":"report"},

We propose sampling to adjust for this imbalance with the goal of improving the performance of models trained on historical production data. We investigate the use of three sampling approaches to adjust for imbalance. The goal is to downsample the covariates in the training data and subsequently fit a regression model. We investigate how the predictive power of the model changes when using either the sampled or the original data for training. We apply our methods on a large biopharmaceutical manufacturing data set from an advanced simulation of penicillin production and find that fitting a model using the sampled data gives a small reduction in the overall predictive performance, but yields a systematically better performance on underrepresented observations.

  {"id":"klugerDefiningTumorResistance2020","abstract":"As the field of cancer immunotherapy continues to advance at a fast pace, treatment approaches and drug development are evolving rapidly to maximize patient benefit. New agents are commonly evaluated for activity in patients who had previously received a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor as standard of care or in an investigational study. However, because of the kinetics and patterns of response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and the lack of consistency in the clinical definitions of resistance to therapy, the design of clinical trials of new agents and interpretation of results remains an important challenge. To address this unmet need, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer convened a multistakeholder taskforce—consisting of experts in cancer immunotherapy from academia, industry, and government—to generate consensus clinical definitions for resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibitors in three distinct scenarios: primary resistance, secondary resistance, and progression after treatment discontinuation. The taskforce generated consensus on several key issues such as the timeframes that delineate each type of resistance, the necessity for confirmatory scans, and identified caveats for each specific resistance classification. The goal of this effort is to provide guidance for clinical trial design and to support analyses of emerging molecular and cellular data surrounding mechanisms of resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Kluger","given":"Harriet M."},{"family":"Tawbi","given":"Hussein A."},{"family":"Ascierto","given":"Maria L."},{"family":"Bowden","given":"Michaela"},{"family":"Callahan","given":"Margaret K."},{"family":"Cha","given":"Edward"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Helen X."},{"family":"Drake","given":"Charles G."},{"family":"Feltquate","given":"David M."},{"family":"Ferris","given":"Robert L."},{"family":"Gulley","given":"James L."},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Humphrey","given":"Rachel W."},{"family":"LaVallee","given":"Theresa M."},{"family":"Le","given":"Dung T."},{"family":"Hubbard-Lucey","given":"Vanessa M."},{"family":"Papadimitrakopoulou","given":"Vassiliki A."},{"family":"Postow","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Eric H."},{"family":"Sharon","given":"Elad"},{"family":"Taube","given":"Janis M."},{"family":"Topalian","given":"Suzanne L."},{"family":"Zappasodi","given":"Roberta"},{"family":"Sznol","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Ryan J."}],"citation-key":"klugerDefiningTumorResistance2020","container-title":"Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1136/jitc-2019-000398","ISSN":"2051-1426","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

  {"id":"Kohler2002","abstract":"Let X be a random vector taking values in Rd, let Y be a bounded random variable, and let C be a right censoring random variable operating on Y. It is assumed that C is independent of (X, Y), the distribution function of C is con- tinuous, and the support of the distribution of Y is a proper subset of the support of the distribution of C. Given a sample [Xi, min[Yi, Ci], I[YiCi]] and a vector of covariates X, we want to construct an estimate of Y such that the mean squared error is minimized. Without censoring, i.e., for C= almost surely, it is well known that the mean squared error of suitably defined kernel, partitioning, nearest neighbor, least squares, and smoothing spline estimates converges for every dis- tribution of (X, Y) to the optimal value almost surely, if the sample size tends to infinity. In this paper, we modify the above estimates and show that in the random right censoring model described above the same is true for the modified estimates.","author":[{"family":"Kohler","given":"M"},{"family":"Máthé","given":"K"},{"family":"Pintér","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Kohler2002","container-title":"Journal of Multivariate Analysis","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]},"title":"Prediction from Randomly Right Censored Data* 1","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0047259X00919730"},

Specifically, the combination of algorithmic and hardware advances with the appearance of large and well-labeled datasets has led up to seminal contributions in these fields.\n          \n            The emergence of large amounts of data from single-cell RNA-seq and the recent global effort to chart all cell types in the Human Cell Atlas has attracted an interest in deep-learning applications. However, all current approaches are unsupervised,\n            i.e.\n            , learning of latent spaces without using any cell labels, even though supervised learning approaches are often more powerful in feature learning and the most popular approach in the current AI revolution by far. Here, we ask why this is the case. In particular we ask whether supervised deep learning can be used for cell annotation,\n            i.e.\n            to predict cell-type labels from single-cell gene expression profiles. After evaluating 10 classification methods across 14 datasets, we notably find that deep learning does not outperform classical machine-learning methods in the task. Thus, cell-type prediction based on gene-signature derived cell-type labels is potentially too simplistic a task for complex non-linear methods, which demands better labels of functional single-cell readouts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Köhler","given":"Niklas D."},{"family":"Büttner","given":"Maren"},{"family":"Andriamanga","given":"Niry"},{"family":"Theis","given":"Fabian J."}],"citation-key":"kohlerDeepLearningDoes2019","DOI":"10.1101/653907","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,31]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Bioinformatics","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Deep learning does not outperform classical machine learning for cell-type annotation","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/653907"},

The diversity, volume and complexity of this aggregated data requires new analysis techniques to extract actionable knowledge. Fundamental to most analysis are key abilities such as: identification of similar cells across different experiments and transferring annotations from an annotated dataset to an unannotated one. There have been many strategies explored in achieving these goals, and they focuses primarily on aligning and re-clustering datasets of interest. In this work, we are interested in exploring the applicability of deep metric learning methods as a form of distance function to capture similarity between cells and facilitate the transfer of cell type annotation for similar cells across different experiments. Toward this aim, we developed MapCell, a few-shot training approach using Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to learn a generalizable distance metric that can differentiate between single cell types. Requiring only a small training set, we demonstrated that SNN derived distance metric can perform accurate transfer of annotation across different scRNA-seq platforms, batches, species and also aid in flagging novel cell types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Koh","given":"Winston"},{"family":"Hoon","given":"Shawn"}],"citation-key":"kohMapCellLearningComparative2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"kolluri_2022","abstract":"Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have become the breakthrough technology most anticipated to have a transformative effect on pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). This is partially driven by revolutionary advances in computational technology and the parallel dissipation of previous constraints to the collection/processing of large volumes of data. Meanwhile, the cost of bringing new drugs to market and to patients has become prohibitively expensive. Recognizing these headwinds, AI/ML techniques are appealing to the pharmaceutical industry due to their automated nature, predictive capabilities, and the consequent expected increase in efficiency. ML approaches have been used in drug discovery over the past 15–20 years with increasing sophistication. The most recent aspect of drug development where positive disruption from AI/ML is starting to occur, is in clinical trial design, conduct, and analysis. The COVID-19 pandemic may further accelerate utilization of AI/ML in clinical trials due to an increased reliance on digital technology in clinical trial conduct. As we move towards a world where there is a growing integration of AI/ML into R&D, it is critical to get past the related buzz-words and noise. It is equally important to recognize that the scientific method is not obsolete when making inferences about data. Doing so will help in separating hope from hype and lead to informed decision-making on the optimal use of AI/ML in drug development. This manuscript aims to demystify key concepts, present use-cases and finally offer insights and a balanced view on the optimal use of AI/ML methods in R&D.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kolluri","given":"Sheela"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jianchang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Rachael"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanwei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenwen"}],"citation-key":"kolluri_2022","container-title":"The AAPS Journal","container-title-short":"AAPS J","DOI":"10.1208/s12248-021-00644-3","ISSN":"1550-7416","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,4]]},"language":"en","page":"19","source":"Springer Link","title":"Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Pharmaceutical Research and Development: a Review","title-short":"Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Pharmaceutical Research and Development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1208/s12248-021-00644-3","volume":"24"},

The controversy surrounding clinical and cost benefits of prostate cancer screening has highlighted the lack of strategies for discriminating high-risk disease (that requires early treatment) from low-risk disease (that could be managed using watchful waiting or active surveillance). Advances in molecular subtyping and multiomics nanotechnology-based prostate cancer risk delineation can enable refinement of prostate cancer molecular taxonomy into clinically meaningful and treatable subtypes. Furthermore, the presence of intertumoural and intratumoural heterogeneity in prostate cancer warrants the development of novel nanodiagnostic technologies to identify clinically significant prostate cancer in a rapid, cost-effective and accurate manner. Circulating and urinary next-generation prostate cancer biomarkers for disease molecular subtyping and the newest complementary nanodiagnostic platforms for enhanced biomarker detection are promising tools for precision prostate cancer management.

  {"id":"kostoulasBayesianWeibullSurvival2010","abstract":"Survival analysis methods can be used to identify factors associated with the time to induction of infection. In the absence of a perfect test, detection of infection is generally delayed and depends on the duration of the latent infection period. We assess, via simulations, the impact of ignoring the delayed detection of infection on estimated survival times and propose a Bayesian Weibull regression model, which adjusts for the delayed detection of infection. The presence of non-differential detection delay seriously biased the baseline hazard and the shape of the hazard function. For differential detection delay, the associated regression coefficients were also biased. The extent of bias largely depended on the longevity of the delay. In all considered simulation scenarios our model led to corrected estimates. We utilized the proposed model in order to assess the age at natural infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in Danish dairy cattle from the analysis of available time to milk-seropositivity data that detected infection with delay. The proposed model captured the inverse relationship between the incidence rate of infection and that of seroconversion with time: susceptibility to infection decreases with time (shape parameter under the proposed model was ρ = 0.56 < 1), while older animals had a higher probability of sero-converting (ρ = 2.67 > 1, under standard Weibull regression).

  {"id":"kostouraki:2024","abstract":"Propensity score methods, such as inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW), have been increasingly used for covariate balancing in both observational studies and randomized trials, allowing the control of both systematic and chance imbalances. Approaches using IPTW are based on two steps: (i) estimation of the individual propensity scores (PS), and (ii) estimation of the treatment effect by applying PS weights. Thus, a variance estimator that accounts for both steps is crucial for correct inference. Using a variance estimator which ignores the first step leads to overestimated variance when the estimand is the average treatment effect (ATE), and to under or overestimated estimates when targeting the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). In this article, we emphasize the importance of using an IPTW variance estimator that correctly considers the uncertainty in PS estimation. We present a comprehensive tutorial to obtain unbiased variance estimates, by proposing and applying a unifying formula for different types of PS weights (ATE, ATT, matching and overlap weights). This can be derived either via the linearization approach or M-estimation. Extensive R code is provided along with the corresponding large-sample theory. We perform simulation studies to illustrate the behavior of the estimators under different treatment and outcome prevalences and demonstrate appropriate behavior of the analytical variance estimator. We also use a reproducible analysis of observational lung cancer data as an illustrative example, estimating the effect of receiving a PET-CT scan on the receipt of surgery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Kostouraki","given":"Andriana"},{"family":"Hajage","given":"David"},{"family":"Rachet","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Chauvet","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Belot","given":"Aurélien"},{"family":"Leyrat","given":"Clémence"}],"citation-key":"kostouraki:2024","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.10078","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"13","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024 The Authors.

  {"id":"kovalchikGeneralBinomialRegression2012","abstract":"Estimates of absolute risks and risk differences are necessary for evaluating the clinical and population impact of biomedical research findings. We have developed a linear-expit regression model (LEXPIT) to incorporate linear and nonlinear risk effects to estimate absolute risk from studies of a binary outcome. The LEXPIT is a generalization of both the binomial linear and logistic regression models. The coefficients of the LEXPIT linear terms estimate adjusted risk differences, whereas the exponentiated nonlinear terms estimate residual odds ratios. The LEXPIT could be particularly useful for epidemiological studies of risk association, where adjustment for multiple confounding variables is common. We present a constrained maximum likelihood estimation algorithm that ensures the feasibility of risk estimates of the LEXPIT model and describe procedures for defining the feasible region of the parameter space, judging convergence, and evaluating boundary cases. Simulations demonstrate that the methodology is computationally robust and yields feasible, consistent estimators. We applied the LEXPIT model to estimate the absolute 5-year risk of cervical precancer or cancer associated with different Pap and human papillomavirus test results in 167,171 women undergoing screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The LEXPIT model found an increased risk due to abnormal Pap test in human papillomavirus-negative that was not detected with logistic regression.

  {"id":"kukreja_2018a","abstract":"Background: For patients with bladder cancer (BC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), complete pathologic absence of tumor (pT0) at radical cystectomy (RC) is associated with better survival. It is unclear if pT0 status can be attributed to the absence of residual disease (cT0) on transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) or to the effects of NAC.\nObjective: To determine how often cT0 is associated with pT0 and identify preoperative and postoperative factors associated with survival. Design, setting, and participants: Between 1995 and 2011, 157 out of 1897 RC patients were identiﬁed as stage cT0 after at least two TURBT procedures at a single center. Intervention: RC with or without NAC. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Initial TURBT pathology and clinical staging were reviewed. The primary endpoint was pathologic stage at RC. Cox proportional hazards ratios identiﬁed factors associated with residual disease at RC, overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-speciﬁc survival (DSS).\nResults and limitations: Of the cT0 patients, 49.7% (n = 78) underwent NAC. pT0 was found in 35.7% (n = 56). Residual tumor was found at RC in 63.7% (n = 101), of whom 24.8% (n = 39) had advanced disease ( pT3 or node-positive disease). Positive lymph nodes at RC were found in 12.7% (n = 20) of the patients. There was no signiﬁcant difference in achieving pT0 status between patients with and without NAC. The presence of advanced BC was most predictive of OS. NAC was associated with longer OS and RFS. During median follow-up of 6.3 yr, the 5-yr RFS was 81% for those with non-advanced disease and 46% for advanced BC (p < 0.001). The 5-yr OS rate was 77% for non-advanced BC and 46% for invasive BC (p < 0.001). Limitations include the retrospective design.\nConclusions: Complete TURBT does not predict pT0 at RC. A notable fraction of patients with cT0 bladders have locally advanced and/or lymph node–positive disease. These ﬁndings may be of value when counseling patients on bladder preservation strategies for muscle-invasive BC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kukreja","given":"Janet Baack"},{"family":"Porten","given":"Sima"},{"family":"Golla","given":"Vishnukamal"},{"family":"Ho","given":"Philip Levy"},{"family":"Noguera-Gonzalez","given":"Graciela"},{"family":"Navai","given":"Neema"},{"family":"Kamat","given":"Ashish M."},{"family":"Dinney","given":"Colin P.N."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Jay B."}],"citation-key":"kukreja_2018a","container-title":"European Urology Focus","container-title-short":"European Urology Focus","DOI":"10.1016/j.euf.2016.12.005","ISSN":"24054569","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9]]},"language":"en","page":"720-724","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Absence of Tumor on Repeat Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor Does Not Predict Final Pathologic T0 Stage in Bladder Cancer Treated with Radical Cystectomy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S240545691630181X","volume":"4"},

Although radical cystectomy (RC) currently is viewed as the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), radiotherapy-based, bladder-sparing trimodal therapy (TMT) that combines transurethral resection of bladder tumor, chemotherapy for radiation sensitization, and external beam radiotherapy has emerged as a valid treatment option. In the absence of randomized studies, this study compared the oncologic outcomes between patients treated with RC or TMT by using a propensity score matched-cohort analysis.\nMethods\n\nData from patients treated in a multidisciplinary bladder cancer clinic (MDBCC) from 2008 to 2013 were reviewed retrospectively. Those who received TMT for MIBC were identified and matched (for sex, cT and cN stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status, Charlson comorbidity score, treatment date, age, carcinoma in situ status, and hydronephrosis) with propensity scores to patients who underwent RC. Overall survival and disease-specific survival (DSS) were assessed with Cox proportional hazards modeling and a competing risk analysis, respectively.\nResults\n\nA total of 112 patients with MIBC were included after matching (56 who had been treated with TMT, and 56 who underwent RC). The median age was 68.0 years, and 29.5% had stage cT3/cT4 disease. At a median follow-up of 4.51 years, there were 20 deaths (35.7%) in the RC group (13 as a result of BC) and 22 deaths (39.3%) in the TMT group (13 as a result of BC). The 5-year DSS rate was 73.2% and 76.6% in the RC and TMT groups, respectively (P = .49). Salvage cystectomy was performed in 6 (10.7%) of 56 patients who received TMT.\nConclusion\n\nIn the setting of a MDBCC, TMT yielded survival outcomes similar to those of matched patients who underwent RC.

For this purpose, a scheme for discretization of continuous-time data is proposed by considering the quantiles of the estimated event-time distribution, and, for smaller data sets, it is found to be preferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two interpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both of which are shown to yield improved performance compared to the discrete-time estimates. The survival methods considered are based on the likelihood for right-censored survival data, and parameterize either the probability mass function (PMF) or the discrete-time hazard rate, both with neural networks. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the hazard rate parametrization is found to perform slightly better than the parametrization of the PMF.

  {"id":"kvammeContinuousDiscretetimeSurvival2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Due to rapid developments in machine learning, and in particular neural networks, a number of new methods for time-to-event predictions have been developed in the last few years. As neural networks are parametric models, it is more straightforward to integrate parametric survival models in the neural network framework than the popular semi-parametric Cox model. In particular, discrete-time survival models, which are fully parametric, are interesting candidates to extend with neural networks. The likelihood for discrete-time survival data may be parameterized by the probability mass function (PMF) or by the discrete hazard rate, and both of these formulations have been used to develop neural network-based methods for time-to-event predictions. In this paper, we review and compare these approaches. More importantly, we show how the discrete-time methods may be adopted as approximations for continuous-time data. To this end, we introduce two discretization schemes, corresponding to equidistant times or equidistant marginal survival probabilities, and two ways of interpolating the discrete-time predictions, corresponding to piecewise constant density functions or piecewise constant hazard rates. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the methods based on the hazard rate parametrization are found to perform slightly better than the methods that use the PMF parametrization. Inspired by these investigations, we also propose a continuous-time method by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant.

Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions.

  {"id":"Lacourt2010","abstract":"Pleural mesothelioma is a primary tumor of the pleura that is mainly due to asbestos exposure. To study the relationship between mesothelioma and occupational asbestos exposure in France, two case-control studies (A and B) were conducted. A substantial difference in the attributable risk in the population (AR(p)) was observed among men: 44.5% (95% CI: [32.6-56.4]) in study A and 83.2% (95% CI: [76.8-89.6]) in study B. As different exposure assessment expert methods were used, the main objective of this work was to re-estimate the AR(p) men in two case-control studies according to a common standardized exposure assessment by using a Job Exposure Matrix (JEM) and to assess the role of subjects' selection. The initial observed AR(p) difference was maintained: 36.3% (95% CI: [24.3-50.3]) in study A and 69.7% (95% CI: [51.7-83.2]) in study B. Further investigations highlighted the potential selection bias introduced in both studies, especially among controls. The AR(p) could be underestimated in study A and overestimated in study B. After weighting subjects according to distribution of socio-economic status in the general population for controls and according to distribution of socio-economic status of cases registered by the French National Mesothelioma Surveillance Program, re-estimated AR(p) values were 52.4% in study A and 70.2% in study B. These results provide additional information to describe the relationship between pleural mesothelioma and occupational asbestos exposure, but also confirm the importance of subjects' recruitment in case control studies, particularly control selection.","author":[{"family":"Lacourt","given":"Aude"},{"family":"Rolland","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Gramond","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Astoul","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Chamming's","given":"Soizick"},{"family":"Ducamp","given":"Stéphane"},{"family":"Frenay","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Galateau-Sallé","given":"Françoise"},{"family":"Gilg Soit Ilg","given":"Anabelle"},{"family":"Imbernon","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Le Stang","given":"Nolwenn"},{"family":"Pairon","given":"Jean Claude"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Iwatsubo","given":"Yuriko"},{"family":"Salmi","given":"Louis-Rachid"},{"family":"Brochard","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"Lacourt2010","container-title":"European journal of epidemiology","event-place":"Laboratoire Santé Travail Environnement, EA 3672, Institut de Santé Publique, d'Epidémiologie et de Développement, Université Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, 33076, Bordeaux, France, aude.lacourt@isped.u-bordeaux2.fr.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher-place":"Laboratoire Santé Travail Environnement, EA 3672, Institut de Santé Publique, d'Epidémiologie et de Développement, Université Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, 33076, Bordeaux, France, aude.lacourt@isped.u-bordeaux2.fr.","title":"Attributable risk in men in two French case-control studies on mesothelioma and asbestos","type":"article-journal","URL":"papers2://publication/doi/10.1007/s10654-010-9502-0"},

  {"id":"Landi2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90% of lung cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have remained obscure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically validated smoking information. ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p¡0.001 and fold-change ¿1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p¡0.001) and TTK (p = 0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers.","author":[{"family":"Landi","given":"Maria Teresa"},{"family":"Dracheva","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Rotunno","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Figueroa","given":"Jonine D"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Huaitian"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Mann","given":"Felecia E"},{"family":"Fukuoka","given":"Junya"},{"family":"Hames","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Bergen","given":"Andrew W"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"Sharon E"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Pesatori","given":"Angela C"},{"family":"Consonni","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Bertazzi","given":"Pier Alberto"},{"family":"Wacholder","given":"Sholom"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Joanna H"},{"family":"Caporaso","given":"Neil E"},{"family":"Jen","given":"Jin"}],"citation-key":"Landi2008","container-title":"PloS One","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"e1651","PMID":"18297132","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Gene expression signature of cigarette smoking and its role in lung adenocarcinoma development and survival.","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"langeSimpleUnifiedApproach2012","abstract":"An important problem within both epidemiology and many social sciences is to break down the effect of a given treatment into different causal pathways and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Formal mediation analysis based on counterfactuals is a key tool when addressing this problem. During the last decade, the theoretical framework for mediation analysis has been greatly extended to enable the use of arbitrary statistical models for outcome and mediator. However, the researcher attempting to use these techniques in practice will often find implementation a daunting task, as it tends to require special statistical programming. In this paper, the authors introduce a simple procedure based on marginal structural models that directly parameterize the natural direct and indirect effects of interest. It tends to produce more parsimonious results than current techniques, greatly simplifies testing for the presence of a direct or an indirect effect, and has the advantage that it can be conducted in standard software. However, its simplicity comes at the price of relying on correct specification of models for the distribution of mediator (and exposure) and accepting some loss of precision compared with more complex methods.

Additionally, the derivation of M-VAE gives new theoretical insights into the popular M1+M2 semi-supervised model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Langevin","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Mehlman","given":"Edouard"},{"family":"Regier","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Michael I."},{"family":"Yosef","given":"Nir"}],"citation-key":"langevinDeepGenerativeModel2018","container-title":"arXiv:1809.05957 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",9,16]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"A Deep Generative Model for Semi-Supervised Classification with Noisy Labels","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05957"},
  {"id":"langholz_1994","abstract":"A stratified version of nested case-control sampling which we call \"countermatching\" is presented. This design uses data available for all cohort members to obtain a sample for collecting additional information in a case-control substudy. Hitherto the only stratified sampling design for such studies has involved matching of controls to cases with respect to confounding variables. However, in some situations, rather than sampling to make controls as similar as possible to cases, we might wish to make them as different as possible. This is achieved by the counter-matched design. Statistical analysis of counter-matched studies is straightforward using existing computer software. We investigate the use of the design when a surrogate measure of exposure is available for the full cohort, but accurate exposure data is to be collected only in a nested case-control study, and when exposure data are available for the whole cohort but data concerning important confounders are not. Asymptotic relative efficiency calculations indicate that a substantial efficiency gain relative to simple random sampling of controls can be expected in these situations. We also illustrate how the design might be implemented in practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Langholz","given":"B"},{"family":"Clayton","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"langholz_1994","container-title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","container-title-short":"Environ Health Perspect","ISSN":"0091-6765","issue":"Suppl 8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",11]]},"page":"47-51","PMCID":"PMC1566552","PMID":"7851330","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Sampling strategies in nested case-control studies.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566552/","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"Laucis2016","abstract":"Hospitals in which a high volume of arthroplasty procedures are performed have been observed to have better outcomes. As the number of arthroplasties has increased, it is not known whether surgical cases have shifted to high-volume hospitals. In this study, we examined the change in the volume of arthroplasties to provide a contemporary definition of \"high-volume\" centers, quantified surgical volume that shifted to high-volume centers, and investigated the resulting effect on complications. Data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (2000 to 2012) were used to quantify trends in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume. Elective primary THAs and TKAs were identified and grouped by hospital by utilizing the hospital identifier, which indicates the geographic location of the hospital. County geographic and population data were obtained from the U.S. Census, and the distances between hospitals and the centroids of counties were calculated. Risk-standardized surgical complication rates for hospitals (2009 to 2012) were obtained from Medicare Hospital Compare and grouped by hospital volume. From 2000 to 2012, there was a marked increase in the number of hospitals that performed a combined volume of 00 elective primary THAs and TKAs. The number of elective primary TKAs and THAs performed annually increased from 343,000 to 851,000. In 2012, 65.5% of the arthroplasties were performed in high-volume hospitals (400 arthroplasties annually), and 26.6% of the arthroplasties were performed in very high-volume hospitals (1,000 procedures annually). The proportion of arthroplasties performed in low-volume hospitals (¡100 arthroplasties annually) shrank from 17.9% to 5.4%. Very high-volume hospitals had the lowest complication rates (2.745 per 100; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.56 to 2.93), and low-volume hospitals had the highest complication rates (3.610 per 100; 95% CI, 3.58 to 3.64; p ¡ 0.0001) (odds ratio, 1.327; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.40). Our analysis showed that 81.9% of the U.S. population lived within 50 miles of a high-volume hospital. Arthroplasty patients are electing to have their procedures at higher-volume hospitals in the United States. Each successively higher hospital volume category manifested a lower complication rate.","author":[{"family":"Laucis","given":"Nicholas C"},{"family":"Chowdhury","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"Laucis2016","container-title":"The Journal of Bone And Joint Surgery.

  {"id":"le-rademacherApplicationMultistateModels2018","abstract":"Background/aims The goal of this article is to illustrate the utility of multi-state models in cancer clinical trials. Our specific aims are to describe multi-state models and how they differ from standard survival methods, to illustrate how multi-state models can facilitate deeper understanding of the treatment effect on multiple paths along the disease process that patients could experience in cancer clinical trials, to explain the differences between multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models, and to briefly describe available software to conduct such analyses. Methods Data from 717 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients who enrolled in the CALGB 10603 trial were used as an illustrative example. The current probability-in-state was estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The restricted mean time in state was calculated as the area under the probability-in-state curves. Cox-type regression was used to evaluate the effect of midostaurin on the various clinical paths. Simulation was conducted using a newly constructed shiny application. All analyses were performed using the R software. Results Multi-state model analyses of CALGB 10603 suggested that the overall improvement in survival with midostaurin seen in the primary analysis possibly resulted from a higher complete remission rate in combination with a lower risk of relapse and of death after complete remission in patients treated with midostaurin. Simulation results, in a three-state illness-death without recovery model, demonstrate that multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models evaluate treatment effects from different frameworks. Conclusion Multi-state models allow detailed evaluation of treatment effects in complex clinical trial settings where patients can experience multiple paths between study enrollment and the final outcome. Multi-state models can be used as a complementary tool to standard survival analyses to provide deeper insights to the effects of treatment in trial settings with complex disease process.","author":[{"family":"Le-Rademacher","given":"Jennifer G."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Ryan A."},{"family":"Therneau","given":"Terry M."},{"family":"Sanford","given":"Ben L."},{"family":"Stone","given":"Richard M."},{"family":"Mandrekar","given":"Sumithra J."}],"citation-key":"le-rademacherApplicationMultistateModels2018","container-title":"Clinical Trials (London, England)","container-title-short":"Clin Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774518789098","ISSN":"1740-7753","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"489-498","PMCID":"PMC6133743","PMID":"30035644","source":"PubMed","title":"Application of multi-state models in cancer clinical trials","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"leeDeepHitDeepLearning2018","abstract":"Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and ﬁnance, engineering, medicine and many other areas. A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times (times-to-event). Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the ﬁrst hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a speciﬁc form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of ﬁrst hitting times (the risk). However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated. This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly. DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time. Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest. Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically signiﬁcant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Changhee"},{"family":"Zame","given":"William"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jinsung"}],"citation-key":"leeDeepHitDeepLearning2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"DeepHit: A Deep Learning Approach to Survival Analysis with Competing Risks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/11842","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"leeDynamicDeepHitDeepLearning2019","abstract":"Currently available risk prediction methods are limited in their ability to deal with complex, heterogeneous, and longitudinal data such as that available in primary care records, or in their ability to deal with multiple competing risks. This paper develops a novel deep learning approach that is able to successfully address current limitations of standard statistical approaches such as landmarking and joint modeling. Our approach, which we call Dynamic-DeepHit, ﬂexibly incorporates the available longitudinal data comprising various repeated measurements (rather than only the last available measurements) in order to issue dynamically updated survival predictions for one or multiple competing risk(s). DynamicDeepHit learns the time-to-event distributions without the need to make any assumptions about the underlying stochastic models for the longitudinal and the time-to-event processes. Thus, unlike existing works in statistics, our method is able to learn datadriven associations between the longitudinal data and the various associated risks without underlying model speciﬁcations. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to a real-world longitudinal dataset from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry which includes a heterogeneous cohort of 5,883 adult patients with annual follow-ups between 2009-2015. The results show that Dynamic-DeepHit provides a drastic improvement in discriminating individual risks of different forms of failures due to cystic ﬁbrosis. Furthermore, our analysis utilizes postprocessing statistics that provide clinical insight by measuring the inﬂuence of each covariate on risk predictions and the temporal importance of longitudinal measurements, thereby enabling us to identify covariates that are inﬂuential for different competing risks.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Changhee"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Jinsung"}],"citation-key":"leeDynamicDeepHitDeepLearning2019","container-title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Dynamic-DeepHit: A Deep Learning Approach for Dynamic Survival Analysis with Competing Risks based on Longitudinal Data","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"leeuwenbergPerformanceBinaryPrediction2022","abstract":"Background\nClinical prediction models are developed widely across medical disciplines. When predictors in such models are highly collinear, unexpected or spurious predictor-outcome associations may occur, thereby potentially reducing face-validity of the prediction model. Collinearity can be dealt with by exclusion of collinear predictors, but when there is no a priori motivation (besides collinearity) to include or exclude specific predictors, such an approach is arbitrary and possibly inappropriate.\n\nMethods\nWe compare different methods to address collinearity, including shrinkage, dimensionality reduction, and constrained optimization. The effectiveness of these methods is illustrated via simulations.\n\nResults\nIn the conducted simulations, no effect of collinearity was observed on predictive outcomes (AUC, R2, Intercept, Slope) across methods. However, a negative effect of collinearity on the stability of predictor selection was found, affecting all compared methods, but in particular methods that perform strong predictor selection (e.g., Lasso). Methods for which the included set of predictors remained most stable under increased collinearity were Ridge, PCLR, LAELR, and Dropout.\n\nConclusions\nBased on the results, we would recommend refraining from data-driven predictor selection approaches in the presence of high collinearity, because of the increased instability of predictor selection, even in relatively high events-per-variable settings. The selection of certain predictors over others may disproportionally give the impression that included predictors have a stronger association with the outcome than excluded predictors.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s41512-021-00115-5.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Leeuwenberg","given":"Artuur M."},{"family":"Smeden","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Langendijk","given":"Johannes A."},{"family":"Schaaf","given":"Arjen","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Mauer","given":"Murielle E."},{"family":"Moons","given":"Karel G.

The proposed statistic is a score statistic derived from a marginal regression model and bears some relation to McNemar's statistic. As McNemar's statistic can be used to compare sensitivities and specificities of diagnostic tests, parameters that condition on disease status, our statistic can be considered as an analog of McNemar's test for the problem of comparing predictive values, parameters that condition on test outcome.

This type of modelling is usually characterised by two submodels, one longitudinal (e.g., mixed-effects model) and one survival (e.g., Cox model), which are connected by some common term. Naturally, sharing information makes the inferential process highly time-consuming. In particular, the Bayesian framework requires even more time for Markov chains to reach stationarity. Hence, in order to reduce the modelling complexity while maintaining the accuracy of the estimates, we propose a two-stage strategy that first fits the longitudinal submodel and then plug the shared information into the survival submodel. Unlike a standard two-stage approach, we apply a correction by incorporating an individual and multiplicative fixed-effect with informative prior into the survival submodel. Based on simulation studies and sensitivity analyses, we empirically compare our proposal with joint specification and standard two-stage approaches. The results show that our methodology is very promising, since it reduces the estimation bias compared to the other two-stage method and requires less processing time than the joint specification approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Leiva-Yamaguchi","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Alvares","given":"Danilo"}],"citation-key":"leiva-yamaguchiTwoStageApproachBayesian2021","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e23010050","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"50","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"A Two-Stage Approach for Bayesian Joint Models of Longitudinal and Survival Data: Correcting Bias with Informative Prior","title-short":"A Two-Stage Approach for Bayesian Joint Models of Longitudinal and Survival Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/1/50","volume":"23"},

This article gives a brief introduction to Bayesian methods and contrasts them with classical hypothesis testing. It shows that the quantification of prior beliefs is a common and necessary part of the interpretation of clinical information, whether from a laboratory test or published clinical trial. Advantages of Bayesian analysis over classical analysis of clinical trials include the ability to incorporate prior information regarding treatment efficacies into the analysis; the ability to make multiple unscheduled inspections of accumulating data without increasing the error rate of the study; and the ability to calculate the probability that one treatment is more effective than another.

However, investigators are often more interested in the difference in survival functions. We propose semiparametric methods to estimate the causal effect of treatment among the treated with respect to survival probability. The objective is to compare post-treatment survival with the survival function that would have been observed in the absence of treatment. For each patient, we compute a prognostic score (based on the pre-treatment death hazard) and a propensity score (based on the treatment hazard). Each treated patient is then matched with an alive, uncensored and not-yet-treated patient with similar prognostic and/or propensity scores. The experience of each treated and matched patient is weighted using a variant of Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting to account for the impact of censoring. We propose estimators of the treatment-specific survival functions (and their difference), computed through weighted Nelson-Aalen estimators. Closed-form variance estimators are proposed which take into consideration the potential replication of subjects across matched sets.

Statin drugs inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver and are typically the first line of therapy to lower elevated levels of LDL-C. On the other hand, a different drug, Ezetimibe, inhibits the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine and provides a different mechanism of action. Many clinical trials have been carried out on safety and efficacy evaluation of cholesterol lowering drugs. To synthesize the results from different clinical trials, we examine treatment level (aggregate) network meta-data from 29 double-blind, randomized, active, or placebo-controlled statins +/$-$ Ezetimibe clinical trials on adult treatment-naïve patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. In this article, we propose a new approach to carry out Bayesian inference for arm-based network meta-regression. Specifically, we develop a new strategy of grouping the variances of random effects, in which we first formulate possible sets of the groups of the treatments based on their clinical mechanisms of action and then use Bayesian model comparison criteria to select the best set of groups. The proposed approach is especially useful when some treatment arms are involved in only a single trial. In addition, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is developed to carry out the posterior computations. In particular, the correlation matrix is generated from its full conditional distribution via partial correlations. The proposed methodology is further applied to analyze the network meta-data from 29 trials with 11 treatment arms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ming-Hui"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Joseph G"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sungduk"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Arvind K"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jianxin"},{"family":"Tershakovec","given":"Andrew M"}],"citation-key":"li_2019","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy014","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"499-516","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian inference for network meta-regression using multivariate random effects with applications to cholesterol lowering drugs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/20/3/499/4975593","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"li_2024","abstract":"Incorporating interim analysis into a trial design is gaining popularity in the field of confirmatory clinical trials, where two studies may be conducted in parallel (ie, twin studies) in order to provide substantial evidence per the requirement of FDA guidance. Interim futility analysis provides a chance to check for the 'disaster' scenario when the treatment has a high probability to be not more efficacious than the control. Therefore, it is an efficient tool to mitigate risk of running a complete and expansive trial under such scenario. There is no agreement among trial designers that interim analysis should be based on individual study data or pooled data under the twin study scenario. In fact, it is a dilemma for most scientists when specifying the interim analysis strategy at the design stage as the true treatment effects of the twin studies are unknown no matter how similar they are intended to be. To address the issue, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical modeling method to allow dynamic data borrowing between twin studies and demonstrated a favorable characteristic of the new method over the separate and pooled analyses. We evaluated a wide spectrum of the heterogeneity hyperparameters and visualized its critical impact on the Bayesian model's characteristic. Based on the evaluation, we made a suggestion on the heterogeneity hyperparameter selection independent of any a priori knowledge.

  {"id":"liang_2023","abstract":"Developing an efficient computational scheme for high-dimensional Bayesian variable selection in generalised linear models and survival models has always been a challenging problem due to the absence of closed-form solutions to the marginal likelihood. The Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) approach can be employed to jointly sample models and coefficients, but the effective design of the trans-dimensional jumps of RJMCMC can be challenging, making it hard to implement. Alternatively, the marginal likelihood can be derived conditional on latent variables using a data-augmentation scheme (e.g., Pólya-gamma data augmentation for logistic regression) or using other estimation methods. However, suitable data-augmentation schemes are not available for every generalised linear model and survival model, and estimating the marginal likelihood using a Laplace approximation or a correlated pseudo-marginal method can be computationally expensive. In this paper, three main contributions are presented. Firstly, we present an extended Point-wise implementation of Adaptive Random Neighbourhood Informed proposal (PARNI) to efficiently sample models directly from the marginal posterior distributions of generalised linear models and survival models. Secondly, in light of the recently proposed approximate Laplace approximation, we describe an efficient and accurate estimation method for marginal likelihood that involves adaptive parameters. Additionally, we describe a new method to adapt the algorithmic tuning parameters of the PARNI proposal by replacing Rao-Blackwellised estimates with the combination of a warm-start estimate and the ergodic average. We present numerous numerical results from simulated data and eight high-dimensional genetic mapping data-sets to showcase the efficiency of the novel PARNI proposal compared with the baseline add–delete–swap proposal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Xitong"},{"family":"Livingstone","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Jim"}],"citation-key":"liang_2023","container-title":"Entropy","DOI":"10.3390/e25091310","ISSN":"1099-4300","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"1310","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Adaptive MCMC for Bayesian Variable Selection in Generalised Linear Models and Survival Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/9/1310","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"liBayesianFunctionalJoint2019","abstract":"A multivariate functional joint model framework is proposed which enables the repeatedly measured functional outcomes, scalar outcomes, and survival process to be modeled simultaneously while accounting for association among the multiple (functional and scalar) longitudinal and survival processes. This data structure is increasingly common across medical studies of neurodegenerative diseases and is exemplified by the motivating Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, in which serial brain imaging, clinical and neuropsychological assessments are collected to measure the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The proposed functional joint model consists of a longitudinal function-on-scalar submodel, a regular longitudinal submodel, and a survival submodel which allows time-dependent functional and scalar covariates. A Bayesian approach is adopted for parameter estimation and a dynamic prediction framework is introduced for predicting the subjects’ future health outcomes and risk of AD conversion.

Due to large variability in time to certain clinical events among patients, studying possibly censored survival phenotypes can be more informative than treating the phenotypes as categorical variables. Due to high dimensionality and censoring, building a predictive model for time to event is more difﬁcult than the classiﬁcation/linear regression problem.

  {"id":"liChoosingTumorMutational2020","abstract":"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of cancer due to its remarkable efficacy and extensive survival benefit in multiple tumor types. However, predictive biomarkers are required to identify patients who are likely to respond to immunotherapy. Recently, tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been shown to be associated with clinical outcomes in diverse cancers, such as melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Several studies have demonstrated that high TMB can effectively predict the objective response rate and progression-free survival, but the ability of TMB to predict overall survival is limited. Thus, the clinical utility of TMB as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in immunotherapy is currently controversial. Importantly, multiple factors can affect the accurate assessment of TMB and further interfere with its prediction of clinical outcomes. These factors include preanalytical factors such as sample status, analytical factors such as differences in platforms and methods for determining TMB and variability of cutoff values, and postanalytical factors such as inconsistent interpretation and reporting of results. In addition, the optimal definition and quantification of TMB are unclear and require harmonization and standardization for reliable clinical application. This review elaborates on the factors affecting TMB status in primary tumors, summarizes the clinical utility of TMB as a biomarker in immunotherapy, and evaluates the impact of each analysis stage on the accurate estimation of TMB, especially its quantification, aiming to facilitate TMB assessment in routine clinical settings.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Han","given":"Dongsheng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jiping"},{"family":"Han","given":"YanXi"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jinming"}],"citation-key":"liChoosingTumorMutational2020","container-title":"Biochimica Et Biophysica Acta.

Accordingly, specificity at the controlled sensitivity, or vice versa, is a clinically sensible performance metric for evaluating continuous biomarkers. Meanwhile, the performance of a biomarker may vary across sub-populations as defined by covariates, and covariate-specific evaluation can be informative. In this article, we develop a novel modeling and estimation method for covariate-specific specificity at a controlled sensitivity level. Unlike existing methods which typically adopt elaborate models of covariate effects over the entire biomarker distribution, our approach models covariate effects locally at a specific sensitivity level of interest. We also extend our proposed model to handle the whole continuum of sensitivities via dynamic regression and derive covariate-specific ROC curves. We provide the variance estimation through bootstrapping. The asymptotic properties are established. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods in comparison with existing methods, and further illustrate the applications in two clinical studies for aggressive prostate cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Ziyi"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yijian"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Dattatraya"},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Sanda","given":"Martin G."}],"citation-key":"liCovariatespecificEvaluationContinuous2023","container-title":"Statistics in medicine","container-title-short":"Stat Med","DOI":"10.1002/sim.9652","ISSN":"0277-6715","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"page":"953-969","PMCID":"PMC10071998","PMID":"36600184","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Covariate-specific evaluation of continuous biomarker","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10071998/","volume":"42"},

As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from DESC are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells.

Here, we aimed at developing a permutation-based methodology relying on a machine learning method, random forest (RF), to detect gene-gene interactions. Our approach called permuted random forest (pRF) which identified the top interacting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs by estimating how much the power of a random forest classification model is influenced by removing pairwise interactions. We systematically tested our approach on a simulation study with datasets possessing various genetic constraints including heritability, number of SNPs, sample size, etc. Our methodology showed high success rates for detecting the interaction SNP pair. We also applied our approach to two bladder cancer datasets, which showed consistent results with well-studied methodologies, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and statistical epistasis network (SEN). Furthermore, we built permuted random forest networks (PRFN), in which we used nodes to represent SNPs and edges to indicate interactions. We successfully developed a scale-invariant methodology to detect pure gene-gene interactions based on permutation strategies and the machine learning method random forest. This methodology showed great potential to be used for detecting gene-gene interactions to study underlying genetic architectures in a scale-free way, which could be benefit to uncover the complex disease mechanisms.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Malley","given":"James D."},{"family":"Andrew","given":"Angeline S."},{"family":"Karagas","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Moore","given":"Jason H."}],"citation-key":"liDetectingGenegeneInteractions2016","container-title":"BioData Mining","DOI":"10.1186/s13040-016-0093-5","ISSN":"17560381","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"number":"1","PMID":"27053949","title":"Detecting gene-gene interactions using a permutation-based random forest method","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"liebermanCaSTLeClassificationSingle2018","abstract":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ”CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,” is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.","author":[{"family":"Lieberman","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Rokach","given":"Lior"},{"family":"Shay","given":"Tal"}],"citation-key":"liebermanCaSTLeClassificationSingle2018","container-title":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0205499","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"PMID":"null","title":"CaSTLe - Classification of single cells by transfer learning: Harnessing the power of publicly available single cell RNA sequencing experiments to annotate new experiments.","type":"article-journal"},

Systematic comparison with published data from 2,554 prostate tumours revealed that the genomic alteration signatures in Chinese patients were markedly distinct from those of Western cohorts: specifically, 41% of tumours contained mutations in FOXA1 and 18% each had deletions in ZNF292 and CHD1. Alterations of the genome and epigenome were correlated and were predictive of disease phenotype and progression.

We describe a novel application of SHAP values to the prediction of mortality risk in prostate cancer. METHODS Patients with nonmetastatic, node-negative prostate cancer, diagnosed between 2004 and 2015, were identified using the National Cancer Database. Model features were specified a priori: age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, percent positive cores (PPC), comorbidity score, and clinical T stage. We trained a gradient-boosted tree model and applied SHAP values to model predictions. Open-source libraries in Python 3.7 were used for all analyses. RESULTS We identified 372,808 patients meeting the inclusion criteria. When analyzing the interaction between PSA and Gleason score, we demonstrated consistency with the literature using the example of low-PSA, high-Gleason prostate cancer, recently identified as a unique entity with a poor prognosis. When analyzing the PPC-Gleason score interaction, we identified a novel finding of stronger interaction effects in patients with Gleason ≥ 8 disease compared with Gleason 6-7 disease, particularly with PPC ≥ 50%. Subsequent confirmatory linear analyses supported this finding: 5-year overall survival in Gleason ≥ 8 patients was 87.7% with PPC < 50% versus 77.2% with PPC ≥ 50% (P < .001), compared with 89.1% versus 86.0% in Gleason 7 patients (P < .001), with a significant interaction term between PPC ≥ 50% and Gleason ≥ 8 (P < .001). CONCLUSION We describe a novel application of SHAP values for modeling and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects in prostate cancer. This ML-based approach is a promising technique with the potential to meaningfully improve risk stratification and staging systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,6]]},"archive_location":"world","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Shinde","given":"Ashwin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"An"},{"family":"Glaser","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Lyou","given":"Yung"},{"family":"Yuh","given":"Bertram"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Amini","given":"Arya"}],"citation-key":"liMachineLearningBased2020","container-title":"JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics","DOI":"10.1200/CCI.20.00002","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,16]]},"language":"EN","license":"© 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology","publisher":"American Society of Clinical Oncology","source":"ascopubs.org","title":"Machine Learning–Based Interpretation and Visualization of Nonlinear Interactions in Prostate Cancer Survival","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/CCI.20.00002"},

  {"id":"liMultiTaskLearningFormulation","abstract":"Predicting the occurrence of a particular event of interest at future time points is the primary goal of survival analysis. The presence of incomplete observations due to time limitations or loss of data traces is known as censoring which brings unique challenges in this domain and diﬀerentiates survival analysis from other standard regression methods. The popularly used survival analysis methods such as Cox proportional hazard model and parametric survival regression suﬀer from some strict assumptions and hypotheses that are not realistic in most of the real-world applications. To overcome the weaknesses of these two types of methods, we reformulate the survival analysis problem as a multi-task learning problem and propose a new multi-task learning based formulation to predict the survival time by estimating the survival status at each time interval during the study duration. We propose an indicator matrix to enable the multitask learning algorithm to handle censored instances and incorporate some of the important characteristics of survival problems such as non-negative non-increasing list structure into our model through max-heap projection. We employ the l2,1-norm penalty to learn a shared representation across related tasks and hence select important features and alleviate over-ﬁtting in high-dimensional feature spaces; thus, reducing the prediction error of each task. To eﬃciently handle the two non-smooth constraints, in this paper, we propose an optimization method which employs Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the proposed multi-task learning problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method using realworld microarray gene expression datasets and show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art methods.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jie"}],"citation-key":"liMultiTaskLearningFormulation","language":"en","page":"10","source":"Zotero","title":"A Multi-Task Learning Formulation for Survival Analysis","type":"article-journal"},

Without imposing any parametric assumption or shape constraint on the underlying dose–response curves, we specify curve-free models for both the toxicity and efficacy endpoints to determine the OBD. By integrating the observed data across all dose levels, the proposed design is coherent in dose assignment and thus greatly enhances efficiency and accuracy in pinning down the right dose. Not only does our design possess a completely new yet flexible dose-finding framework, but it also has satisfactory and robust performance as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. In addition, we show that our design enjoys desirable coherence properties, while most of existing phase I/II designs do not.

Nine scenarios representing the PH and various non-PH patterns were simulated. The power, type-I error, and effect estimates of each method were compared. In general, all tests control type I error well. There is not a single most powerful test across all scenarios. In the absence of prior knowledge regarding the PH or non-PH patterns, the MaxCombo test is relatively robust across patterns. Since the treatment effect changes overtime under non-PH, the overall profile of the treatment effect may not be represented comprehensively based on a single measure.

Microarray analyses compared gene expression profiles of intestine cell from Gucy2c(-/-) and wild-type mice. v akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) regulation and signaling were examined, and the role of AKT in GUCY2C-dependent tumorigenesis was defined in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice. RESULTS: The size and number of intestinal crypts increased in Gucy2c(-/-) mice; the associated epithelial cells showed accelerated proliferation, increased glycolysis, and reduced oxidative phosphorylation, which was reversed by oral administration of cGMP. Conversely, activating guanylyl cyclase C in human colon cancer cells delayed cell-cycle progression, decreased DNA synthesis and colony formation, reduced glycolysis, and increased mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production. AKT signaling pathways were activated in intestines of Gucy2c(-/-) mice, associated with increased AKT phosphorylation. Disruption of AKT activity, pharmacologically or genetically, reduced DNA synthesis, proliferation, and glycolysis, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Intestinal tumorigenesis increased after administration of azoxymethane to Gucy2c(-/-) mice, compared with wild-type mice, but was eliminated in Gucy2c(-/-)Akt1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: GUCY2C is a tumor suppressor that controls proliferation and metabolism of intestinal epithelial cells by inactivating AKT signaling. This receptor and its ligands, which are paracrine hormones, might be novel candidates for anticolorectal cancer therapy.","author":[{"family":"Lin","given":"Jieru Egeria"},{"family":"Li","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Snook","given":"Adam Eugene"},{"family":"Schulz","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Hyslop","given":"Terry Marie"},{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Ahmara Vivian"},{"family":"Marszlowicz","given":"Glen"},{"family":"Pitari","given":"Giovanni Mario"},{"family":"Waldman","given":"Scott Arthur"}],"citation-key":"Lin2010","container-title":"Gastroenterology","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1]]},"page":"241-54","PMID":"19737566","publisher-place":"United States","title":"The hormone receptor GUCY2C suppresses intestinal tumor formation by inhibiting AKT signaling.","type":"article-journal","volume":"138"},

Machine learning algorithms have been proposed as an alternative to conventional logistic regression for modelling PS in order to avoid limitations of linear methods. We introduce classification tree analysis (CTA) to generate PS which is a “decision-tree”-like classification model that provides accurate, parsimonious decision rules that are easy to display and interpret, reports P values derived via permutation tests, and evaluates cross-generalizability. Method Using empirical data, we identify all statistically valid CTA PS models and then use them to compute strata-specific, observation-level PS weights that are subsequently applied in outcomes analyses. We compare findings obtained using this framework to logistic regression and boosted regression, by evaluating covariate balance using standardized differences, model predictive accuracy, and treatment effect estimates obtained using median regression and a weighted CTA outcomes model. Results While all models had some imbalanced covariates, main-effects logistic regression yielded the lowest average standardized difference, whereas CTA yielded the greatest predictive accuracy. Nevertheless, treatment effect estimates were generally consistent across all models. Conclusions Assessing standardized differences in means as a test of covariate balance is inappropriate for machine learning algorithms that segment the sample into two or more strata.

However, it has come to the forefront in many new modern data-intensive disciplines.

Transcriptomic analysis identifies four classes (1, 2a, 2b and 3) reflecting tumor biology and disease aggressiveness. Both transcriptome-based subtyping and the level of chromosomal instability provide independent prognostic value beyond established prognostic clinicopathological parameters. High chromosomal instability, p53-pathway disruption and APOBEC-related mutations are significantly associated with transcriptomic class 2a and poor outcome. RNA-derived immune cell infiltration is associated with chromosomally unstable tumors and enriched in class 2b. Spatial proteomics analysis confirms the higher infiltration of class 2b tumors and demonstrates an association between higher immune cell infiltration and lower recurrence rates. Finally, the independent prognostic value of the transcriptomic classes is documented in 1228 validation samples using a single sample classification tool.

  {"id":"lindskrog_2023","abstract":"AbstractPurpose:. To investigate whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assessment in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer predicts treatment response and provides early detection of metastatic disease.Experimental Design:. We present full follow-up results (median follow-up: 68 months) from a previously described cohort of 68 neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)-treated patients who underwent longitudinal ctDNA testing (712 plasma samples). In addition, we performed ctDNA evaluation of 153 plasma samples collected before and after radical cystectomy (RC) in a separate cohort of 102 NAC-naïve patients (median follow-up: 72 months). Total RNA sequencing of tumors was performed to investigate biological characteristics of ctDNA shedding tumors.Results:. Assessment of ctDNA after RC identified metastatic relapse with a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 98% using the expanded follow-up data for the NAC-treated patients. ctDNA dynamics during NAC was independently associated with patient outcomes when adjusted for pathologic downstaging (HR = 4.7; P = 0.029). For the NAC-naïve patients, ctDNA was a prognostic predictor before (HR = 3.4; P = 0.0005) and after RC (HR = 17.8; P = 0.0002). No statistically significant difference in recurrence-free survival for patients without detectable ctDNA at diagnosis was observed between the cohorts. Baseline ctDNA positivity was associated with the Basal/Squamous (Ba/Sq) subtype and enrichment of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell cycle–associated gene sets.Conclusions:. ctDNA is prognostic in NAC-treated and NAC-naïve patients with more than 5 years follow-up and outperforms pathologic downstaging in predicting treatment efficacy. Patients without detectable ctDNA at diagnosis may benefit significantly less from NAC, but additional studies are needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Lindskrog","given":"Sia V."},{"family":"Birkenkamp-Demtröder","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Nordentoft","given":"Iver"},{"family":"Laliotis","given":"George"},{"family":"Lamy","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Emil"},{"family":"Renner","given":"Derrick"},{"family":"Andreasen","given":"Tine G."},{"family":"Lange","given":"Naja"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Shruti"},{"family":"ElNaggar","given":"Adam C."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Minetta C."},{"family":"Sethi","given":"Himanshu"},{"family":"Aleshin","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Agerbæk","given":"Mads"},{"family":"Jensen","given":"Jørgen B."},{"family":"Dyrskjøt","given":"Lars"}],"citation-key":"lindskrog_2023","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin Cancer Res","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-23-1860","ISSN":"1078-0432","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"4797-4807","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research","source":"aacrjournals.org","title":"Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma: Insights from Biological Analysis and Extended Clinical Follow-up","title-short":"Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/29/23/4797/730213/Circulating-Tumor-DNA-Analysis-in-Advanced","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"liNeuralNetworkbasedMethod2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The fast-advancing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology enables researchers to study the transcriptome of heterogeneous tissues at a single cell level. The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as “unassigned.” These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types. However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work, we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data contain closely correlated cell types. We show that NeuCA can achieve more accurate cell annotation results compared with existing methods. Additionally, the applications on eight real datasets show that NeuCA has stable performance for intra- and inter-study annotation, as well as cross-condition annotation.

Prostate cancer is notable for the remarkable diversity in clinical outcomes that range from an indolent course, with no impact on the patient if left untreated, to rapid progression to metastatic disease and cancer-specific death. Consequently, treatment options also span conservative approaches, such as active surveillance to radical curative therapy that involves prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Unfortunately, these interventions have adverse effects that can substantially affect quality of life. Thus, a major objective involves stratifying patients based on individual risk for aggressive disease behavior and basing treatment recommendations accordingly. Traditionally, risk stratification uses readily available clinical parameters that include the level of serum prostate-specific antigen, clinical stage, and the histological Gleason grade assessed from prostate biopsy.

  {"id":"lipkovichSubgroupIdentificationBased2011","abstract":"We propose a novel recursive partitioning method for identifying subgroups of subjects with enhanced treatment effects based on a differential effect search algorithm. The idea is to build a collection of subgroups by recursively partitioning a database into two subgroups at each parent group, such that the treatment effect within one of the two subgroups is maximized compared with the other subgroup. The process of data splitting continues until a predefined stopping condition has been satisfied. The method is similar to ‘interaction tree’ approaches that allow incorporation of a treatment-by-split interaction in the splitting criterion. However, unlike other tree-based methods, this method searches only within specific regions of the covariate space and generates multiple subgroups of potential interest. We develop this method and provide guidance on key topics of interest that include generating multiple promising subgroups using different splitting criteria, choosing optimal values of complexity parameters via cross-validation, and addressing Type I error rate inflation inherent in data mining applications using a resampling-based method. We evaluate the operating characteristics of the procedure using a simulation study and illustrate the method with a clinical trial example.

One essential step to understanding cellular heterogeneity is determining cell identities. The widely used strategy predicts identities by projecting cells or cell clusters unidirectionally against a reference to find the best match. Here, we develop a bidirectional method, scMRMA, where a hierarchical reference guides iterative clustering and deep annotation with enhanced resolutions. Taking full advantage of the reference, scMRMA greatly improves the annotation accuracy. scMRMA achieved better performance than existing methods in four benchmark datasets and successfully revealed the expansion of CD8 T cell populations in squamous cell carcinoma after anti-PD-1 treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Sheng","given":"Quanhu"},{"family":"Shyr","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qi"}],"citation-key":"liScMRMASingleCell2022","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","DOI":"10.1093/nar/gkab931","ISSN":"0305-1048, 1362-4962","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"e7-e7","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"scMRMA: single cell multiresolution marker-based annotation","title-short":"scMRMA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/2/e7/6396893","volume":"50"},

  {"id":"liSubspaceAdversarialTraining2021","abstract":"Single-step adversarial training (AT) has received wide attention as it proved to be both efficient and robust. However, a serious problem of catastrophic overfitting exists, i.e., the robust accuracy against projected gradient descent (PGD) attack suddenly drops to $0\\%$ during the training. In this paper, we understand this problem from a novel perspective of optimization and firstly reveal the close link between the fast-growing gradient of each sample and overfitting, which can also be applied to understand the robust overfitting phenomenon in multi-step AT. To control the growth of the gradient during the training, we propose a new AT method, subspace adversarial training (Sub-AT), which constrains the AT in a carefully extracted subspace. It successfully resolves both two kinds of overfitting and hence significantly boosts the robustness. In subspace, we also allow single-step AT with larger steps and larger radius, which further improves the robustness performance. As a result, we achieve the state-of-the-art single-step AT performance: our pure single-step AT can reach over $\\mathbf{51}\\%$ robust accuracy against strong PGD-50 attack with radius $8/255$ on CIFAR-10, even surpassing the standard multi-step PGD-10 AT with huge computational advantages.

  {"id":"litwinDiagnosisTreatmentProstate2017","abstract":"Importance: Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis made in men with more than 160 000 new cases each year in the United States. Although it often has an indolent course, prostate cancer remains the third-leading cause of cancer death in men.\nObservations: When prostate cancer is suspected, tissue biopsy remains the standard of care for diagnosis. However, the identification and characterization of the disease have become increasingly precise through improved risk stratification and advances in magnetic resonance and functional imaging, as well as from the emergence of biomarkers. Multiple management options now exist for men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Active surveillance (the serial monitoring for disease progression with the intent to cure) appears to be safe and has become the preferred approach for men with less-aggressive prostate cancer, particularly those with a prostate-specific antigen level of less than 10 ng/mL and Gleason score 3 + 3 tumors. Surgery and radiation continue to be curative treatments for localized disease but have adverse effects such as urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction that can negatively affect quality of life. For metastatic disease, chemotherapy as initial treatment now appears to extend survival compared with androgen deprivation therapy alone. New vaccines, hormonal therapeutics, and bone-targeting agents have demonstrated efficacy in men with metastatic prostate cancer resistant to traditional hormonal therapy.\nConclusions and Relevance: Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer have improved the ability to stratify patients by risk and allowed clinicians to recommend therapy based on cancer prognosis and patient preference. Initial treatment with chemotherapy can improve survival compared with androgen deprivation therapy. Abiraterone, enzalutamide, and other agents can improve outcomes in men with metastatic prostate cancer resistant to traditional hormonal therapy.","author":[{"family":"Litwin","given":"Mark S."},{"family":"Tan","given":"Hung-Jui"}],"citation-key":"litwinDiagnosisTreatmentProstate2017","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.2017.7248","ISSN":"1538-3598","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"2532-2542","PMID":"28655021","source":"PubMed","title":"The Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Review","title-short":"The Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"317"},

  {"id":"liuDeepProbabilityEstimation2021","abstract":"Reliable probability estimation is of crucial importance in many real-world applications where there is inherent uncertainty, such as weather forecasting, medical prognosis, or collision avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Probability-estimation models are trained on observed outcomes (e.g. whether it has rained or not, or whether a patient has died or not), because the ground-truth probabilities of the events of interest are typically unknown. The problem is therefore analogous to binary classification, with the important difference that the objective is to estimate probabilities rather than predicting the specific outcome. The goal of this work is to investigate probability estimation from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. There exist several methods to improve the probabilities generated by these models but they mostly focus on classification problems where the probabilities are related to model uncertainty. In the case of problems with inherent uncertainty, it is challenging to evaluate performance without access to ground-truth probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to study and compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on the synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks, all of which involve inherent uncertainty: precipitation forecasting from radar images, predicting cancer patient survival from histopathology images, and predicting car crashes from dashcam videos. Finally, we also propose a new method for probability estimation using neural networks, which modifies the training process to promote output probabilities that are consistent with empirical probabilities computed from the data. The method outperforms existing approaches on most metrics on the simulated as well as real-world data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Kaku","given":"Aakash"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Weicheng"},{"family":"Leibovich","given":"Matan"},{"family":"Mohan","given":"Sreyas"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Boyang"},{"family":"Zanna","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Razavian","given":"Narges"},{"family":"Fernandez-Granda","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"liuDeepProbabilityEstimation2021","container-title":"arXiv:2111.10734 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Deep Probability Estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10734"},

Here we systematically evaluate the effect of different eligibility criteria on cancer trial populations and outcomes with real-world data using the computational framework of Trial Pathfinder. We apply Trial Pathfinder to emulate completed trials of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer using data from a nationwide database of electronic health records comprising 61,094 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Our analyses reveal that many common criteria, including exclusions based on several laboratory values, had a minimal effect on the trial hazard ratios. When we used a data-driven approach to broaden restrictive criteria, the pool of eligible patients more than doubled on average and the hazard ratio of the overall survival decreased by an average of 0.05. This suggests that many patients who were not eligible under the original trial criteria could potentially benefit from the treatments. We further support our findings through analyses of other types of cancer and patient-safety data from diverse clinical trials.

  {"id":"liuScAnnoDeconvolutionStrategybased2023","abstract":"Undoubtedly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has changed the research landscape by providing insights into heterogeneous, complex and rare cell populations. Given that more such data sets will become available in the near future, their accurate assessment with compatible and robust models for cell type annotation is a prerequisite. Considering this, herein, we developed scAnno (scRNA-seq data annotation), an automated annotation tool for scRNA-seq data sets primarily based on the single-cell cluster levels, using a joint deconvolution strategy and logistic regression. We explicitly constructed a reference profile for human (30 cell types and 50 human tissues) and a reference profile for mouse (26 cell types and 50 mouse tissues) to support this novel methodology (scAnno). scAnno offers a possibility to obtain genes with high expression and specificity in a given cell type as cell type-specific genes (marker genes) by combining co-expression genes with seed genes as a core. Of importance, scAnno can accurately identify cell type-specific genes based on cell type reference expression profiles without any prior information. Particularly, in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set, the marker genes identified by scAnno showed cell type-specific expression, and the majority of marker genes matched exactly with those included in the CellMarker database. Besides validating the flexibility and interpretability of scAnno in identifying marker genes, we also proved its superiority in cell type annotation over other cell type annotation tools (SingleR, scPred, CHETAH and scmap-cluster) through internal validation of data sets (average annotation accuracy: 99.05%) and cross-platform data sets (average annotation accuracy: 95.56%).

If attributable risk is close to zero or one, normality cannot be assumed and log-transformed confidence intervals must be used.

Developers of such models often rely on approaches that aim to minimize the risk of overfitting and improve predictive performance of the logistic model, such as through likelihood penalization and variance decomposition techniques. We present an extensive simulation study that compares the out-of-sample predictive performance of risk prediction models derived using the elastic net, with Lasso and ridge as special cases, and variance decomposition techniques, namely, incomplete principal component regression and incomplete partial least squares regression. We varied the expected events per variable, event fraction, number of candidate predictors, presence of noise predictors, and the presence of sparse predictors in a full-factorial design. Predictive performance was compared on measures of discrimination, calibration, and prediction error. Simulation metamodels were derived to explain the performance differences within model derivation approaches. Our results indicate that, on average, prediction models developed using penalization and variance decomposition approaches outperform models developed using ordinary maximum likelihood estimation, with penalization approaches being consistently superior over the variance decomposition approaches. Differences in performance were most pronounced on the calibration of the model. Performance differences regarding prediction error and concordance statistic outcomes were often small between approaches.

  {"id":"Lok2004","abstract":"Large observational studies have become commonplace in medical research. Treatment may be adapted to covariates at several instances without a fixed protocol. Estimation or even definition of treatment effect is difficult in that case. Treatment influences covariates, which influence treatment, which influences covariates, etcetera. To distinguish between these options, even the famous time-dependent Cox-model cannot be used. Robins (1992, 1998), Keiding (1999) and Lok (2001, 2004) study Structural Nested Models to estimate treatment effects even in this difficult setting. Their methods are based on so-called counterfactuals: the outcome a patient would have had if treatment was withheld after a certain time. It is clearly impossible for these outcomes to be observed in all patients. Yet we will show how counterfactual thinking is a very helpful tool to study estimation of treatment effect in the presence of time-dependent covariates. Previous work on these models was usually based on the assumption that the correct model combined with observations made it possible to calculate all counterfactuals for each patient. This assumption was considered not plausible, since it assumes the exact same treatment effect for each patient. This paper provides the cornerstone for the relaxation of treatment effects in e.g. Robins (1992, 1998) or Keiding (1999) in that, at least if there is no censoring, the assumption that counterfactuals are connected with the observed data in a deterministic way is not necessary. We hope that this will contribute to the discussion about causal reasoning.","author":[{"family":"Lok","given":"J J"}],"citation-key":"Lok2004","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Library","title":"Mimicking counterfactual outcomes for the estimation of causal effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0409045v1","volume":"math.ST"},
  {"id":"longatoPracticalPerspectiveConcordance2020","abstract":"Developing a prognostic model for biomedical applications typically requires mapping an individual’s set of covariates to a measure of the risk that he or she may experience the event to be predicted. Many scenarios, however, especially those involving adverse pathological outcomes, are better described by explicitly accounting for the timing of these events, as well as their probability. As a result, in these cases, traditional classification or ranking metrics may be inadequate to inform model evaluation or selection. To address this limitation, it is common practice to reframe the problem in the context of survival analysis, and resort, instead, to the concordance index (C-index), which summarises how well a predicted risk score describes an observed sequence of events. A practically meaningful interpretation of the C-index, however, may present several difficulties and pitfalls. Specifically, we identify two main issues: i) the C-index remains implicitly, and subtly, dependent on time, and ii) its relationship with the number of subjects whose risk was incorrectly predicted is not straightforward. Failure to consider these two aspects may introduce undesirable and unwanted biases in the evaluation process, and even result in the selection of a suboptimal model. Hence, here, we discuss ways to obtain a meaningful interpretation in spite of these difficulties. Aiming to assist experimenters regardless of their familiarity with the C-index, we start from an introductory-level presentation of its most popular estimator, highlighting the latter’s temporal dependency, and suggesting how it might be correctly used to inform model selection. We also address the nonlinearity of the C-index with respect to the number of correct risk predictions, elaborating a simplified framework that may enable an easier interpretation and quantification of C-index improvements or deteriorations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Longato","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Vettoretti","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Di Camillo","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"longatoPracticalPerspectiveConcordance2020","container-title":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103496","ISSN":"1532-0464","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,1]]},"page":"103496","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A practical perspective on the concordance index for the evaluation and selection of prognostic time-to-event models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046420301246","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"longJointModelingMultivariate2018","abstract":"Background: Joint modeling is appropriate when one wants to predict the time to an event with covariates that are measured longitudinally and are related to the event. An underlying random effects structure links the survival and longitudinal submodels and allows for individual-specific predictions. Multiple time-varying and time-invariant covariates can be included to potentially increase prediction accuracy. The goal of this study was to estimate a multivariate joint model on several longitudinal observational studies of Huntington’s disease, examine external validity performance, and compute individual-specific predictions for characterizing disease progression. Emphasis was on the survival submodel for predicting the hazard of motor diagnosis.\nMethods: Data from four observational studies was analyzed: Enroll-HD, PREDICT-HD, REGISTRY, and Track-HD. A Bayesian approach to estimation was adopted, and external validation was performed using a time-varying AUC measure. Individual-specific cumulative hazard predictions were computed based on a simulation approach. The cumulative hazard was used for computing predicted age of motor onset and also for a deviance residual indicating the discrepancy between observed diagnosis status and model-based status.\nResults: The joint model trained in a single study had very good performance in discriminating among diagnosed and pre-diagnosed participants in the remaining test studies, with the 5-year mean AUC = .83 (range .77–.90), and the 10-year mean AUC = .86 (range .82–.92). Graphical analysis of the predicted age of motor diagnosis showed an expected strong relationship with the trinucleotide expansion that causes Huntington’s disease. Graphical analysis of the deviance-type residual revealed there were individuals who converted to a diagnosis despite having relatively low model-based risk, others who had not yet converted despite having relatively high risk, and the majority falling between the two extremes.\nConclusions: Joint modeling is an improvement over traditional survival modeling because it considers all the longitudinal observations of covariates that are predictive of an event. Predictions from joint models can have greater accuracy because they are tailored to account for individual variability. These predictions can provide relatively accurate characterizations of individual disease progression, which might be important in the timing of interventions, determining the qualification for appropriate clinical trials, and general genotypic analysis.","author":[{"family":"Long","given":"Jeffrey D"}],"citation-key":"longJointModelingMultivariate2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"15","source":"Zotero","title":"Joint modeling of multivariate longitudinal data and survival data in several observational studies of Huntington’s disease","type":"article-journal"},

This approach yields biased estimates of the expected risk, and therefore leads to poor decisions for two reasons. First, the model ﬁt with AEVB may not equal the underlying data distribution. Second, the variational distribution may not equal the posterior distribution under the ﬁtted model. We explore how ﬁtting the variational distribution based on several objective functions other than the ELBO, while continuing to ﬁt the generative model based on the ELBO, affects the quality of downstream decisions. For the probabilistic principal component analysis model, we investigate how importance sampling error, as well as the bias of the model parameter estimates, varies across several approximate posteriors when used as proposal distributions. Our theoretical results suggest that a posterior approximation distinct from the variational distribution should be used for making decisions. Motivated by these theoretical results, we propose learning several approximate proposals for the best model and combining them using multiple importance sampling for decision-making.

In parallel, recent advances in unsupervised machine learning, particularly in transfer learning, have enabled fast and scalable mapping of these new single-cell datasets onto reference atlases. The resulting large-scale machine learning models however often have millions of parameters, rendering interpretation of the newly mapped datasets challenging. Here, we propose expiMap, a deep learning model that enables interpretable reference mapping using biologically understandable entities, such as curated sets of genes and gene programs. The key concept is the substitution of the uninterpretable nodes in an autoencoder’s bottleneck by labeled nodes mapping to interpretable lists of genes, such as gene ontologies, biological pathways, or curated gene sets, for which activities are learned as constraints during reconstruction. This is enabled by the incorporation of predefined gene programs into the reference model, and at the same time allowing the model to learn\n            de novo\n            new programs and refine existing programs during reference mapping. We show that the model retains similar integration performance as existing methods while providing a biologically interpretable framework for understanding cellular behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of expiMap by applying it to 15 datasets encompassing five different tissues and species. The interpretable nature of the mapping revealed unreported associations between interferon signaling via the RIG-I/MDA5 and GPCRs pathways, with differential behavior in CD8\n            +\n            T cells and CD14\n            +\n            monocytes in severe COVID-19, as well as the role of annexins in the cellular communications between lymphoid and myeloid compartments for explaining patient response to the applied drugs.

  {"id":"lou_2021","abstract":"A key factor in designing randomized clinical trials is the sample size required to achieve a particular level of power to detect the benefit of a treatment. Sample size calculations depend upon the expected benefits of a treatment (effect size), the accuracy of measurement of the primary outcome, and the level of power specified by the investigators. In this study, we show that radiomic models, which leverage complex brain MRI patterns and machine learning, can be utilized in clinical trials with protocols that incorporate baseline MR imaging to significantly increase statistical power to detect treatment effects. Akin to the historical control paradigm, we propose to utilize a radiomic prediction model to generate a pseudo-control sample for each individual in the trial of interest. Because the variability of expected outcome across patients can mask our ability to detect treatment effects, we can increase the power to detect a treatment effect in a clinical trial by reducing that variability through using radiomic predictors as surrogates.

We present sample size requirements across a range of effect sizes using conventional analysis and models that include a radiomic predictor. For our Alzheimer’s disease cohort, at an effect size of 0.35, total sample size requirements for 80% power declined from 246 to 212 for the endpoint cognitive decline.

  {"id":"lu_2003","abstract":"Left-truncation or censoring of lifetime observation occurs in many applications. For instance, a crack on the body of a plane may become visible after it starts, a study may permit a process that has progressed to certain level, or a clinical trial may admit a subject who contracted the disease at an unspecified point of time, etc. Typically, the left-truncated observations are either discarded or misused when this type of data is analyzed. If a large portion of the data is left truncated, it may result in a significant loss of information. Moreover, any statistical analysis conducted on the data may be severely biased toward the non-truncated (complete) observations. When auxiliary information is available for the lifetimes of interest, a simple likelihood based model incorporating this auxiliary information can be constructed to estimate the truncated segment of the lifetimes. Using the estimated as well as the complete set of data, maximization of the conditional expectation of the log-likelihood function given the known part of the truncated data will provide a valid upgrade for the parameter estimates. When left-truncated observations are present in the data, this likelihood-based approach is theoretically appealing and sound therefore, has great potentiality over models based on the complete observations alone.

The resulting parsimonious models will facilitate meaningful biological interpretation and scientific findings. Variable selection via Bayesian inference has been receiving significant advancement in recent years. Despite its increasing popularity, there is limited practical guidance for implementing these Bayesian approaches and evaluating their comparative performance in clinical datasets. In this paper, we review several commonly used Bayesian approaches to variable selection, with emphasis on application and implementation through R software. These approaches can be roughly categorized into four classes: namely the Bayesian model selection, spike-and-slab priors, shrinkage priors, and the hybrid of both. To evaluate their variable selection performance under various scenarios, we compare these four classes of approaches using real and simulated datasets. These results provide practical guidance to researchers who are interested in applying Bayesian approaches for the purpose of variable selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Zihang"},{"family":"Lou","given":"Wendy"}],"citation-key":"lu_2022","container-title":"The International Journal of Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1515/ijb-2020-0130","ISSN":"1557-4679","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"83-108","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian approaches to variable selection: a comparative study from practical perspectives","title-short":"Bayesian approaches to variable selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ijb-2020-0130/html","volume":"18"},

In particular, we propose a novel neural-PK/PD framework that combines key pharmacological principles with neural ordinary differential equations. We applied it to an analysis of drug concentration and platelet response from a clinical dataset consisting of over 600 patients. We show that the neural-PK/PD model improves on a state-of-the-art model with respect to metrics for temporal prediction. Furthermore, by incorporating key PK/PD concepts into its architecture, the model can generalize and enable the simulations of patient responses to untested dosing regimens.

Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15% of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30%, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.

  {"id":"lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017","abstract":"Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott M."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Su-In"}],"citation-key":"lundbergUnifiedApproachInterpreting2017","collection-title":"NIPS'17","container-title":"Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems","event-place":"Red Hook, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-5108-6096-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,4]]},"page":"4768–4777","publisher":"Curran Associates Inc.","publisher-place":"Red Hook, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A unified approach to interpreting model predictions","type":"paper-conference"},

This algorithm implements a surrogate likelihood function to approximate the Cox log-partial likelihood function that is stratified by site using patient-level data from a lead site and aggregated information from other sites, allowing the baseline hazard functions and the distribution of covariates to vary across sites. Simulation studies and application to a real-world opioid use disorder study showed that ODACH provides estimates close to the pooled estimator, which analyzes patient-level data directly from all sites via a stratified Cox model. Compared to the estimator from meta-analysis, the inverse variance-weighted average of the site-specific estimates, ODACH estimator demonstrates less susceptibility to bias, especially when the event is rare. ODACH is thus a valuable privacy-preserving and communication-efficient method for analyzing multi-center time-to-event data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Chongliang"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Naj","given":"Adam C."},{"family":"Kranzler","given":"Henry R."},{"family":"Bian","given":"Jiang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"luoODACHOneshotDistributed2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-09069-0","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,22]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-8","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"ODACH: a one-shot distributed algorithm for Cox model with heterogeneous multi-center data","title-short":"ODACH","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09069-0","volume":"12"},

Physical activity and SB estimated from soj-1x, soj-3x, and a neural network previously calibrated in the laboratory (lab-nnet) were compared with direct observation.\n\nRESULTS:Compared with lab-nnet, soj-1x and soj-3x improved estimates of MET-hours (lab-nnet: % bias [95% confidence interval] = 33.1 [25.9 to 40.4], root-mean-square error [RMSE] = 5.4 [4.6-6.2]; soj-1x: % bias = 1.9 [-2.0 to 5.9], RMSE = 1.0 [0.6 to 1.3]; soj-3x: % bias = 3.4 [0.0 to 6.7], RMSE = 1.0 [0.6 to 1.5]) and minutes in different intensity categories {lab-nnet: % bias = -8.2 (sedentary), -8.2 (light), and 72.8 (moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA]); soj-1x: % bias = 8.8 (sedentary), -18.5 (light), and -1.0 (MVPA); soj-3x: % bias = 0.5 (sedentary), -0.8 (light), and -1.0 (MVPA)}. Soj-1x and soj-3x also produced accurate estimates of guideline minutes and breaks from sedentary time.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:Compared with the lab-nnet algorithm, soj-1x and soj-3x improved the accuracy and precision in estimating free-living MET-hours, sedentary time, and time spent in light-intensity activity and MVPA. In addition, soj-3x is superior to soj-1x in differentiating SB from light-intensity activity.","author":[{"family":"Lyden","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Keadle","given":"Sarah Kozey"},{"family":"Staudenmayer","given":"John"},{"family":"Freedson","given":"Patty S"}],"citation-key":"lydenMethodEstimateFreeliving2014","container-title":"Medicine and science in sports and exercise","event-place":"1Department of Kinesiology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA; and 2Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA.","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"number":"2","page":"386-397","publisher-place":"1Department of Kinesiology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA; and 2Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA.","title":"A method to estimate free-living active and sedentary behavior from an accelerometer.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=23860415&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"46"},

In general, inference about principal causal effects can be challenging, particularly when there are two active treatments; the problem is exacerbated for continuous measures of compliance. We address this issue by first proposing a structural model for the principal effects. We then specify compliance models within each arm of the study. These marginal models are identifiable. The joint distribution of the observed and counterfactual compliance variables is assumed to follow a Gaussian copula model, which links the two marginal models and includes a dependence parameter that cannot be identified. This dependence parameter can be varied as part of a sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the methodology with an analysis of data from a smoking cessation trial.

Because of this inherent trade-off, likelihood ratios provide a clinically relevant means of comparing the combined test with one of its components. The likelihood ratios depend on both sensitivity and specificity and hence take into account the trade-off between them. A graphical approach is used to assess whether the combined test is superior to a component test, or vice versa. Asymptotic standard errors are derived for comparing likelihood ratios when a paired study design is used. The trade-off in the expected number of additional true positive and false positive results (or true negative and false negative results) is used as the basis for deciding whether to use tests in combination when neither the combined nor a component test shows superior test performance based on their likelihood ratios.

Unless evidence of the dependence of clinical benefit on biomarker classification is a priori unequivocal, personalized drug development needs to jointly investigate treatments and biomarkers in clinical trials. Motivated by the development of contemporary cancer treatments, we propose targeting three main questions sequentially in order to determine (1) whether a drug is efficacious, (2) whether a biomarker can personalize treatment, and (3) how to define personalization. For time-to-event data satisfying the Cox proportional hazards model, we show that (1) and (2) may not directly involve the variance of an interaction term but of a contrast with smaller variance. An asymptotically exact covariance matrix for the parameter vector in the CPH model is derived to construct sample size formulae and an inference approach for thresholds of continuous biomarkers. The covariance matrix also reveals strategies for greater efficiency in trial design, for example, when the biomarker is binary or does not modulate the effect of treatment in the control arm.

  {"id":"Maclin2011","abstract":"An ensemble consists of a set of individually trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting (Freund and Shapire, 1996; Shapire, 1990) are two relatively new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks and decision trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can create ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier -- especially when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance of the Boosting methods is dependent on the characteristics of the data set being examined. In fact, further results show that Boosting ensembles may overfit noisy data sets, thus decreasing its performance. Finally, consistent with previous studies, our work suggests that most of the gain in an ensemble's performance comes in the first few classifiers combined; however, relatively large gains can be seen up to 25 classifiers when Boosting decision trees.\n\nPublished in: Journal Of Artificial Intelligence Research, Volume 11, pages\n  169-198, 1999","author":[{"family":"Maclin","given":"R"},{"family":"Opitz","given":"D"}],"citation-key":"Maclin2011","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Library","title":"Popular Ensemble Methods: An Empirical Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0257v1","volume":"cs.AI"},

Due to the complicated interaction between a tumor and its microenvironment, single biomarkers, such as PDL1 protein level, tumor mutational burden (TMB), single gene mutation and expression, are far from satisfactory for response prediction or patient stratification. Recently, combinatorial biomarkers were reported to be more precise and powerful for predicting therapy response and identifying potential target populations with superior survival. However, there is a lack of dedicated tools for such combinatorial biomarker analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Here, we present\n                dualmarker\n                , an R package designed to facilitate the data exploration for dual biomarker combinations. Given two biomarkers,\n                dualmarker\n                comprehensively visualizes their association with drug response and patient survival through 14 types of plots, such as boxplots, scatterplots, ROCs, and Kaplan–Meier plots. Using logistic regression and Cox regression models,\n                dualmarker\n                evaluated the superiority of dual markers over single markers by comparing the data fitness of dual-marker versus single-marker models, which was utilized for de novo searching for new biomarker pairs. We demonstrated this straightforward workflow and comprehensive capability by using public biomarker data from one bladder cancer patient cohort (IMvigor210 study); we confirmed the previously reported biomarker pair TMB/TGF-beta signature and CXCL13 expression/ARID1A mutation for response and survival analyses, respectively. In addition,\n                dualmarker\n                de novo identified new biomarker partners, for example, in overall survival modelling, the model with combination of HMGB1 expression and ARID1A mutation had statistically better goodness-of-fit than the model with either HMGB1 or ARID1A as single marker.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              \n                The\n                dualmarker\n                package is an open-source tool for the visualization and identification of combinatorial dual biomarkers.

Single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (scRNA-seq) might be leveraged to reveal the function of intra-clonal CNVs; however, it cannot directly link cellular gene expression to CNVs. Here, we report a high-throughput scRNA-seq analysis pipeline that provides paired CNV profiles and transcriptomes for single cells, enabling exploration of the effects of CNVs on cellular programs. RTAM1 and -2 normalization methods are described, and are shown to improve transcriptome alignment between cells, increasing the sensitivity of scRNA-seq for CNV detection. We also report single-cell inferred chromosomal copy number variation (sciCNV), a tool for inferring single-cell CNVs from scRNA-seq at 19-46 Mb resolution. Comparison of sciCNV with existing RNA-based CNV methods reveals useful advances in sensitivity and specificity. Using sciCNV, we demonstrate that scRNA-seq can be used to examine the cellular effects of cancer CNVs. As an example, sciCNV is used to identify subclonal multiple myeloma (MM) cells with +8q22-24. Studies of the gene expression of intra-clonal MM cells with and without the CNV demonstrate that +8q22-24 upregulates MYC and MYC-target genes, messenger RNA processing and protein synthesis, which is consistent with established models. In conclusion, we provide new tools for scRNA-seq that enable paired profiling of the CNVs and transcriptomes of single cells, facilitating rapid and accurate deconstruction of the effects of cancer CNVs on cellular programming.","author":[{"family":"Mahdipour-Shirayeh","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Erdmann","given":"Natalie"},{"family":"Leung-Hagesteijn","given":"Chungyee"},{"family":"Tiedemann","given":"Rodger E."}],"citation-key":"mahdipour-shirayehSciCNVHighthroughputPaired2022","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Brief Bioinform","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbab413","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,17]]},"language":"eng","page":"bbab413","PMID":"34655292","source":"PubMed","title":"sciCNV: high-throughput paired profiling of transcriptomes and DNA copy number variations at single-cell resolution","title-short":"sciCNV","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

However, probabilities are required for risk estimation using individual patient characteristics. It has been shown recently that every statistical learning machine known to be consistent for a nonparametric regression problem is a probability machine that is provably consistent for this estimation problem. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to show how random forests and nearest neighbors can be used for consistent estimation of individual probabilities. METHODS: Two random forest algorithms and two nearest neighbor algorithms are described in detail for estimation of individual probabilities. We discuss the consistency of random forests, nearest neighbors and other learning machines in detail. We conduct a simulation study to illustrate the validity of the methods. We exemplify the algorithms by analyzing two well-known data sets on the diagnosis of appendicitis and the diagnosis of diabetes in Pima Indians. RESULTS: Simulations demonstrate the validity of the method. With the real data application, we show the accuracy and practicality of this approach. We provide sample code from R packages in which the probability estimation is already available. This means that all calculations can be performed using existing software.

To this end, we introduce a novel probabilistic approach to cluster survival data in a variational deep clustering setting. Our proposed method employs a deep generative model to uncover the underlying distribution of both the explanatory variables and the potentially censored survival times.

  {"id":"Marino2008","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability and repeatability of the motor and sensory examination of the International Standards for Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) in trained examiners. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Sixteen examiners (8 physicians, 8 physical therapists) with clinical SCI experience and 16 patients participated in a reliability study in preparation for a clinical trial involving individuals with acute SCI. After a training session on the standards, each examiner evaluated 3 patients for motor, light touch (LT), and pin prick (PP). The following day, 15 examiners reevaluated one patient. Interrater reliability was determined using intraclass correlation coefficients (1-way, random effects model). Intrarater reliability was determined using a 2-way random effects model. Repeatability was determined using the method of Bland and Altman. RESULTS: Patients were classified as complete tetraplegia (n = 5), incomplete tetraplegia (n = 5), complete paraplegia (n = 5), and incomplete paraplegia (n = 1). Overall, inter-rater reliability was high: motor = 0.97, LT = 0.96, PP = 0.88. Repeatability values were small in patients with complete SCI (motor ¡ 2 points, sensory ¡ 7 points) but large for patients with incomplete SCI. Intra-rater reliability values were ¿ or = 0.98 for patients with complete SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The summed scores for motor, LT, and PP in subjects with complete SCI have high inter-rater reliability and small repeatability values. These measures are appropriately reliable for use in clinical trials involving serial neurological examinations with multiple examiners. Further research in subjects with incomplete SCI is needed to determine whether repeatability is acceptably small.","author":[{"family":"Marino","given":"Ralph J"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Kirshblum","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Tal","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhiijit"}],"citation-key":"Marino2008","container-title":"The Journal Of Spinal Cord Medicine","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1079-0268 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"166-70","PMID":"18581663","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Reliability and repeatability of the motor and sensory examination of the international standards for neurological classification of spinal cord injury.","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"martinClinicalPredictionModels2021","abstract":"Clinical prediction models (CPMs) can predict clinically relevant outcomes or events. Typically, prognostic CPMs are derived to predict the risk of a single future outcome. However, there are many medical applications where two or more outcomes are of interest, meaning this should be more widely reflected in CPMs so they can accurately estimate the joint risk of multiple outcomes simultaneously. A potentially naïve approach to multi-outcome risk prediction is to derive a CPM for each outcome separately, then multiply the predicted risks. This approach is only valid if the outcomes are conditionally independent given the covariates, and it fails to exploit the potential relationships between the outcomes. This paper outlines several approaches that could be used to develop CPMs for multiple binary outcomes. We consider four methods, ranging in complexity and conditional independence assumptions: namely, probabilistic classifier chain, multinomial logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, and a Bayesian probit model. These are compared with methods that rely on conditional independence: separate univariate CPMs and stacked regression. Employing a simulation study and real-world example, we illustrate that CPMs for joint risk prediction of multiple outcomes should only be derived using methods that model the residual correlation between outcomes. In such a situation, our results suggest that probabilistic classification chains, multinomial logistic regression or the Bayesian probit model are all appropriate choices. We call into question the development of CPMs for each outcome in isolation when multiple correlated or structurally related outcomes are of interest and recommend more multivariate approaches to risk prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Martin","given":"Glen P."},{"family":"Sperrin","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Snell","given":"Kym I.

  {"id":"martinez_2014","abstract":"2013 marked the 250th anniversary of the presentation of Bayes’ theorem by the philosopher Richard Price. Thomas Bayes was a figure little known in his own time, but in the 20th century the theorem that bears his name became widely used in many fields of research. The Bayes theorem is the basis of the so-called Bayesian methods, an approach to statistical inference that allows studies to incorporate prior knowledge about relevant data characteristics into statistical analysis. Nowadays, Bayesian methods are widely used in many different areas such as astronomy, economics, marketing, genetics, bioinformatics and social sciences. This study observed that a number of authors discussed recent advances in techniques and the advantages of Bayesian methods for the analysis of epidemiological data. This article presents an overview of Bayesian methods, their application to epidemiological research and the main areas of epidemiology which should benefit from the use of Bayesian methods in coming years.\n          , \n            Durante el año 2013 se conmemora el 250 aniversario de la presentación del teorema de Bayes por el filósofo Richard Price ante la Royal Society en 1763.

The Cox model is assumed to be correctly specified, and we investigate whether the typical end product of such an analysis, the estimated hazard ratio, has a causal interpretation as a hazard ratio. It has been pointed out that this is not possible due to selection. We provide more insight into the interpretation of hazard ratios and differences, investigating what can be learned about a treatment effect from the hazard ratio approaching unity after a certain period of time. The conclusion is that the Cox hazard ratio is not causally interpretable as a hazard ratio unless there is no treatment effect or an untestable and unrealistic assumption holds. We give a hazard ratio that has a causal interpretation and study its relationship to the Cox hazard ratio.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Martinussen","given":"Torben"}],"citation-key":"martinussenCausalityCoxRegression2022","container-title":"Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application","container-title-short":"Annu.

We studied genomic aberrations in primary prostate cancer biopsies from patients who developed mCRPC, also studying matching, same-patient, diagnostic, and mCRPC biopsies following treatment. We profiled 470 treatment-naive prostate cancer diagnostic biopsies and, for 61 cases, mCRPC biopsies, using targeted and low-pass whole-genome sequencing (n = 52). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize mutation and copy number profile. Prevalence was compared using Fisher's exact test. Survival correlations were studied using log-rank test. TP53 (27%) and PTEN (12%) and DDR gene defects (BRCA2 7%; CDK12 5%; ATM 4%) were commonly detected. TP53, BRCA2, and CDK12 mutations were markedly more common than described in the TCGA cohort. Patients with RB1 loss in the primary tumor had a worse prognosis. Among 61 men with matched hormone-naive and mCRPC biopsies, differences were identified in AR, TP53, RB1, and PI3K/AKT mutational status between same-patient samples. In conclusion, the genomics of diagnostic prostatic biopsies acquired from men who develop mCRPC differ from those of the nonlethal primary prostatic cancers. RB1/TP53/AR aberrations are enriched in later stages, but the prevalence of DDR defects in diagnostic samples is similar to mCRPC.","author":[{"family":"Mateo","given":"Joaquin"},{"family":"Seed","given":"George"},{"family":"Bertan","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Rescigno","given":"Pasquale"},{"family":"Dolling","given":"David"},{"family":"Figueiredo","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Miranda","given":"Susana"},{"family":"Nava Rodrigues","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gurel","given":"Bora"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Atkin","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Chandler","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Messina","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Sumanasuriya","given":"Semini"},{"family":"Bianchini","given":"Diletta"},{"family":"Barrero","given":"Maialen"},{"family":"Petermolo","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Zafeiriou","given":"Zafeiris"},{"family":"Fontes","given":"Mariane"},{"family":"Perez-Lopez","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Tunariu","given":"Nina"},{"family":"Fulton","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Robert"},{"family":"McGovern","given":"Ursula"},{"family":"Ralph","given":"Christy"},{"family":"Varughese","given":"Mohini"},{"family":"Parikh","given":"Omi"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Suneil"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Sandhu","given":"Shahneen"},{"family":"Porta","given":"Nuria"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Carreira","given":"Suzanne"},{"family":"Bono","given":"Johann S.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"mateoGenomicsLethalProstate2020","container-title":"The Journal of Clinical Investigation","container-title-short":"J Clin Invest","DOI":"10.1172/JCI132031","ISSN":"1558-8238","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"1743-1751","PMCID":"PMC7108902","PMID":"31874108","source":"PubMed","title":"Genomics of lethal prostate cancer at diagnosis and castration resistance","type":"article-journal","volume":"130"},
  {"id":"Matheny2005","abstract":"OBJECTIVES:Using a local percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) data repository, we sought to compare the performance of a number of local and well-known mortality models with respect to discrimination and calibration.\n\nBACKGROUND:Accurate risk prediction is important for a number of reasons including physician decision support, quality of care assessment, and patient education. Current evidence on the value of applying PCI risk models to individual cases drawn from a different population is controversial.\n\nMETHODS:Data were collected from January 01, 2002 to September 30, 2004 on 5216 consecutive percutaneous coronary interventions at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA). Logistic regression was used to create a local risk model for in-hospital mortality in these procedures, and a number of statistical methods were used to compare the discrimination and calibration of this new and old local risk models, as well as the Northern New England Cooperative Group, New York State (1992 and 1997), University of Michigan consortium, American College of Cardiology-National Cardiovascular Data Registry, and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation risk prediction models. Areas under the ROC (AUC) curves were used to evaluate discrimination, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves assessed applicability of the models to individual cases.\n\nRESULTS:Multivariate risk factors included in the newly constructed local model were: age, prior intervention, diabetes, unstable angina, salvage versus elective procedure, cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and left anterior descending artery intervention. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.929 (SE=0.017), and the p value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit was 0.473. This indicates good discrimination and calibration. Bootstrap re-sampling indicated AUC stability. Evaluation of the external models showed an AUC range from 0.82 to 0.90 indicating good discrimination across all models, but poor calibration (HL p value < or = 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:Validation of AUC values across all models suggests that certain risk factors have remained important over the last decade. However, the lack of calibration suggests that small changes in patient populations and data collection methods quickly reduce the accuracy of patient level estimations over time. Possible solutions to this problem involve either recalibration of models using local data or development of new local models.","author":[{"family":"Matheny","given":"M E"},{"family":"Ohno-Machado","given":"L"},{"family":"Resnic","given":"F S"}],"citation-key":"Matheny2005","container-title":"Journal of biomedical informatics","event-place":"Decision Systems Group, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. mmatheny@dsg.harvard.edu","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"number":"5","page":"367-375","publisher":"Elsevier Science","publisher-place":"Decision Systems Group, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. mmatheny@dsg.harvard.edu","title":"Discrimination and calibration of mortality risk prediction models in interventional cardiology.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=16198996&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"matthewsAnalysisSerialMeasurements1990","abstract":"In medical research data are often collected serially on subjects. The statistical analysis of such data is often inadequate in two ways: it may fail to settle clinically relevant questions and it may be statistically invalid. A commonly used method which compares groups at a series of time points, possibly with t tests, is flawed on both counts. There may, however, be a remedy, which takes the form of a two stage method that uses summary measures. In the first stage a suitable summary of the response in an individual, such as a rate of change or an area under a curve, is identified and calculated for each subject. In the second stage these summary measures are analysed by simple statistical techniques as though they were raw data. The method is statistically valid and likely to be more relevant to the study questions. If this method is borne in mind when the experiment is being planned it should promote studies with enough subjects and sufficient observations at critical times to enable useful conclusions to be drawn. Use of summary measures to analyse serial measurements, though not new, is potentially a useful and simple tool in medical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Matthews","given":"J.

Several prediction models have been developed to explore the relationship between patients’ covariates and survival. However, the high-dimensional genomic features limit the prediction performance of the survival model. Thus, an accurate and reliable prediction model is necessary for survival analysis using high-dimensional genomic data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In this study, we proposed an improved survival prediction model based on XGBoost framework called XGBLC, which used Lasso-Cox to enhance the ability to analyze high-dimensional genomic data. The novel first- and second-order gradient statistics of Lasso-Cox were defined to construct the loss function of XGBLC. We extensively tested our XGBLC algorithm on both simulated and real-world datasets, and estimated the performance of models with 5-fold cross-validation. Based on 20 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), XGBLC outperforms five state-of-the-art survival methods in terms of C-index, Brier score and AUC. The results show that XGBLC still keeps good accuracy and robustness by comparing the performance on the simulated datasets with different scales.

  {"id":"mazza_2018","abstract":"Purpose:\nWe report the outcomes in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer from 2 institutions who experienced a clinically complete response to neoadjuvant platinum based chemotherapy and elected active surveillance. It was unknown whether conservative treatment could be safely implemented in these patients.\n\nMaterials and Methods:\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer at our institutions who elected surveillance following a clinically complete response to transurethral resection of bladder tumors and neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 2001 to 2017. A clinically complete response was defined as absent tumor on post-chemotherapy transurethral resection of bladder tumor, negative cytology and normal cross-sectional imaging.\n\nResults:\nIn the 148 patients followed a median of 55 months (range 5 to 145) the 5-year disease specific, overall, cystectomy-free and recurrence-free survival rates were 90%, 86%, 76% and 64%, respectively. Of the patients 71 (48%) experienced recurrence in the bladder, including 16 (11%) with muscle invasive disease and 55 (37%) with noninvasive disease. Salvage radical cystectomy prevented cancer specific death in 9 of 12 patients (75%) who underwent cystectomy after muscle invasive relapse and in 13 of 14 (93%) after noninvasive relapse.\n\nConclusions:\nWe observed high rates of overall and disease specific survival with bladder preservation in patients who achieved a clinically complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These outcomes support the safety of active surveillance in carefully selected, closely monitored patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Future studies should aim to improve patient selection by identifying biomarkers predicting invasive relapse and developing novel imaging methods of early detection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazza","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Moran","given":"George W."},{"family":"Li","given":"Gen"},{"family":"Robins","given":"Dennis J."},{"family":"Matulay","given":"Justin T."},{"family":"Herr","given":"Harry W."},{"family":"Decastro","given":"Guarionex J."},{"family":"McKiernan","given":"James M."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Christopher B."}],"citation-key":"mazza_2018","container-title":"The Journal of urology","container-title-short":"J Urol","DOI":"10.1016/j.juro.2018.05.078","ISSN":"0022-5347","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"page":"1005-1013","PMCID":"PMC7543664","PMID":"29787740","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Conservative Management Following Complete Clinical Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: Contemporary Outcomes of a Multi-Institutional Cohort Study","title-short":"Conservative Management Following Complete Clinical Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543664/","volume":"200"},

  {"id":"mccaffreyTutorialPropensityScore2013","abstract":"The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non- randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are two-fold: (1) to provide step- by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. Tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments are also provided. A case study examining the effects of three treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse demonstrates the methods.","author":[{"family":"Mccaffrey","given":"Daniel F."},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Beth Ann"},{"family":"Almirall","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Slaughter","given":"Mary Ellen"},{"family":"Ramchand","given":"Rajeev"},{"family":"Burgette","given":"Lane F."}],"citation-key":"mccaffreyTutorialPropensityScore2013","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.5753","ISBN":"1097-0258","ISSN":"02776715","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"PMID":"23508673","title":"A tutorial on propensity score estimation for multiple treatments using generalized boosted models","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"mccandless:2009","abstract":"In the analysis of observational data, stratifying patients on the estimated propensity scores reduces confounding from measured variables. Confidence intervals for the treatment effect are typically calculated without acknowledging uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores, and intuitively this may yield inferences, which are falsely precise. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian method that models the propensity score as a latent variable. We consider observational studies with a dichotomous treatment, dichotomous outcome, and measured confounders where the log odds ratio is the measure of effect. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used for posterior simulation. We study the impact of modelling uncertainty in the propensity scores in a case study investigating the effect of statin therapy on mortality in Ontario patients discharged from hospital following acute myocardial infarction. Our analysis reveals that the Bayesian credible interval for the treatment effect is 10 per cent wider compared with a conventional propensity score analysis. Using simulations, we show that when the association between treatment and confounders is weak, then this increases uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores. Bayesian interval estimates for the treatment effect are longer on average, though there is little improvement in coverage probability. A novel feature of the proposed method is that it fits models for the treatment and outcome simultaneously rather than one at a time. The method uses the outcome variable to inform the fit of the propensity model. We explore the performance of the estimated propensity scores using cross-validation.

Since many life-shortening events are related to diseases, we developed a Mendelian randomization-based method combining 58 disease-related GWA studies to derive longevity priors for all HapMap SNPs. A Bayesian association scan, informed by these priors, for parental age of death in the UK Biobank study (n=116,279) revealed 16 independent SNPs with significant Bayes factor at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). Eleven of them replicate (5% FDR) in five independent longevity studies combined; all but three are depleted of the life-shortening alleles in older Biobank participants. Further analysis revealed that brain expression levels of nearby genes (RBM6, SULT1A1 and CHRNA5) might be causally implicated in longevity. Gene expression and caloric restriction experiments in model organisms confirm the conserved role for RBM6 and SULT1A1 in modulating lifespan.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"McDaid","given":"Aaron F."},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Peter K."},{"family":"Porcu","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Komljenovic","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Li","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Sorrentino","given":"Vincenzo"},{"family":"Litovchenko","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Bevers","given":"Roel P.

Patients with high-risk disease have an increased risk of developing biochemical recurrence, metastases, and death from prostate cancer. As the optimal management of high-risk disease in patients with prostate cancer continues to evolve, the contemporary treatment paradigm is moving toward a multidisciplinary integrated approach of systemic and local therapy for patients with high-risk disease. The strategies for definitive, adjuvant, and salvage local treatment, including radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, serve as the backbone of therapy for patients with localized disease. Systemic therapy decisions regarding use in combination with surgery, choice of therapy (hormone therapy, chemotherapy), and treatment duration continue to be refined. As more effective hormonal agents populate the treatment landscape for advanced prostate cancer, including abiraterone and next-generation antiandrogens, an opportunity is provided to explore these treatments in patients with localized disease in the hope of improving the long-term outcome for patients. Integration of innovative blood and tissue-based biomarkers to guide therapy selection for patients with high-risk disease is an area of active research. Contemporary studies are using such biomarkers to stratify patients and select therapies. In this review, we summarize contemporary evidence for local treatment strategies, systemic therapy options, and biomarkers in development for the management of high-risk prostate cancer in patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McKay","given":"Rana R."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Felix Y."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Alice Y."},{"family":"Wallis","given":"Christopher J.

Under the assumption that the biomarker effect sizes have the same correlation structure as the biomarkers, the required sample size does not depend upon these correlations, but only upon Copt and upon the sparsity of the distribution of effect sizes, deﬁned by the proportion of biomarkers that have nonzero effects . To learn a classiﬁer that extracts 80% of the predictive information, the required case sample size varies from about 0.1 cases per variable for a panel with Copt = 0.9 and a sparse distribution of effect sizes (such that 1% of biomarkers have nonzero effect sizes) to nine cases per variable for a panel with Copt = 0.75 and a diffuse distribution of effect sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"McKeigue","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"mckeigueSampleSizeRequirements2019","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/0962280217738807","ISSN":"0962-2802, 1477-0334","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"language":"en","page":"904-910","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sample size requirements for learning to classify with high-dimensional biomarker panels","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0962280217738807","volume":"28"},

Bayesian methods do not rely on asympotics, a property that can be a hindrance when employing frequentist methods in small sample contexts. Although Bayesian methods are better equipped to model data with small sample sizes, estimates are highly sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution. If this aspect is not heeded, Bayesian estimates can actually be worse than frequentist methods, especially if frequentist small sample corrections are utilized. We show with illustrative simulations and applied examples that relying on software defaults or diffuse priors with small samples can yield more biased estimates than frequentist methods.

We first examine whether the latter problem, estimation of P[y = 1|x], can be solved with Logit- Boost, and with AdaBoost when combined with a natural link function. The answer is negative: both approaches are often ineffective because they overfit P[y = 1|x] even though they perform well as classifiers. A major negative point of the present article is the disconnect between class probability estimation and classification.\nNext we consider the practice of over/under-sampling of the two classes. We present an al- gorithm that uses AdaBoost in conjunction with Over/Under-Sampling and Jittering of the data (“JOUS-Boost”). This algorithm is simple, yet successful, and it preserves the advantage of rela- tive protection against overfitting, but for arbitrary misclassification costs and, equivalently, arbi- trary quantile boundaries. We then use collections of classifiers obtained from a grid of quantiles to form estimators of class probabilities. The estimates of the class probabilities compare favorably to those obtained by a variety of methods across both simulated and real data sets.","author":[{"family":"Mease","given":"D"},{"family":"Wyner","given":"A"},{"family":"Buja","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Mease2007","container-title":"The Journal of Machine Learning …","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"title":"Boosted classification trees and class probability/quantile estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248659.1248675"},

  {"id":"mengVariationalBayesianRepresentation2021","abstract":"Representation learning has been widely applied in real-world recommendation systems to capture the features of both users and items. Existing grocery recommendation methods only represent each user and item by single deterministic points in a low-dimensional continuous space, which limit the expressive ability of their embeddings, resulting in recommendation performance bottlenecks. In addition, existing representation learning methods for grocery recommendation only consider the items (products) as independent entities, neglecting their other valuable side information, such as the textual descriptions and the categorical data of items. In this paper, we propose the Variational Bayesian Context-Aware Representation (VBCAR) model for grocery recommendation. VBCAR is a novel variational Bayesian model that learns distributional representations of users and items by leveraging basket context information from historical interactions. Our VBCAR model is also extendable to leverage side information by encoding contextual features into representations based on the inference encoder. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world grocery datasets to assess the effectiveness of our model as well as the impact of different construction strategies for item side information. Our results show that our VBCAR model outperforms the current state-of-the-art grocery recommendation models while integrating item side information (especially the categorical features with the textual information of items) results in further significant performance gains. Furthermore, we demonstrate through analysis that our model is able to effectively encode similarities between product types, which we argue is the primary reason for the observed effectiveness gains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Meng","given":"Zaiqiao"},{"family":"McCreadie","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Macdonald","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Ounis","given":"Iadh"}],"citation-key":"mengVariationalBayesianRepresentation2021","container-title":"Information Retrieval Journal","container-title-short":"Inf Retrieval J","DOI":"10.1007/s10791-021-09397-1","ISSN":"1573-7659","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"347-369","source":"Springer Link","title":"Variational Bayesian representation learning for grocery recommendation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10791-021-09397-1","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"Mercier2009","abstract":"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mutations, such as P132L, are associated with ER-positive human breast cancers. However, no immunohistochemical methods have yet been described to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations in human breast cancer. Since the P132L mutation acts in a dominant-negative fashion and causes the mis-localization of Cav-1 in cultured cells in vitro, we hypothesized that of patients carrying this mutation would show a similar Cav-1 staining pattern in vivo. Indeed, while performing histological analysis of Cav-1 immunostaining on human breast cancer samples, we noted the emergence of two distinct epithelial staining patterns: (1) punctate peri-nuclear \"Golgi-like\" localization; or (2) diffuse cytoplasmic staining. The punctate peri-nuclear staining pattern was associated with ER-alpha positivity and was present mainly in well-differentiated samples. In striking contrast, the diffuse staining pattern was present in poorly differentiated samples, and was not associated with ER-status. DNA sequence analysis revealed that only well-differentiated samples with a punctate staining pattern harbored the Cav-1 P132L mutation. Thus, immunostaining of Cav-1 can be used as a first step to stratify human breast cancer patients and to predict the presence of Cav-1 mutations. As such, the punctate Cav-1 immunostaining pattern can now be used as a screening tool to select patients for Cav-1 mutational analysis.","author":[{"family":"Mercier","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Kelly G"},{"family":"Sotgia","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Bonuccelli","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Jasmin","given":"Jean-Francois"},{"family":"Pestell","given":"Richard G"},{"family":"Lisanti","given":"Michael P"}],"citation-key":"Mercier2009","container-title":"Cell Cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","DOI":"10.4161/cc.8.9.8307","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1551-4005 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"page":"1396-401","PMID":"19342880","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Using Caveolin-1 epithelial immunostaining patterns to stratify human breast cancer patients and predict the Caveolin-1 (P132L) mutation.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.4161/cc.8.9.8307","volume":"8"},

We introduce Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB), a technique for training Variational Autoencoders with arbitrarily expressive inference models. We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation. Contrary to competing approaches which combine VAEs with GANs, our approach has a clear theoretical justification, retains most advantages of standard Variational Autoencoders and is easy to implement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mescheder","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Nowozin","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Geiger","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"meschederAdversarialVariationalBayes2018","container-title":"arXiv:1701.04722 [cs]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,11]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Adversarial Variational Bayes: Unifying Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks","title-short":"Adversarial Variational Bayes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04722"},

  {"id":"meyer:2022","abstract":"Platform trials have become increasingly popular for drug development programs, attracting interest from statisticians, clinicians and regulatory agencies. Many statistical questions related to designing platform trials—such as the impact of decision rules, sharing of information across cohorts, and allocation ratios on operating characteristics and error rates—remain unanswered. In many platform trials, the definition of error rates is not straightforward as classical error rate concepts are not applicable. For an open-entry, exploratory platform trial design comparing combination therapies to the respective monotherapies and standard-of-care, we define a set of error rates and operating characteristics and then use these to compare a set of design parameters under a range of simulation assumptions. When setting up the simulations, we aimed for realistic trial trajectories, such that for example, a priori we do not know the exact number of treatments that will be included over time in a specific simulation run as this follows a stochastic mechanism. Our results indicate that the method of data sharing, exact specification of decision rules and a priori assumptions regarding the treatment efficacy all strongly contribute to the operating characteristics of the platform trial. Furthermore, different operating characteristics might be of importance to different stakeholders. Together with the potential flexibility and complexity of a platform trial, which also impact the achieved operating characteristics via, for example, the degree of efficiency of data sharing this implies that utmost care needs to be given to evaluation of different assumptions and design parameters at the design stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Elias Laurin"},{"family":"Mesenbrink","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Dunger-Baldauf","given":"Cornelia"},{"family":"Glimm","given":"Ekkehard"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuhan"},{"family":"König","given":"Franz"},{"family":"Consortium","given":"EU-PEARL (EU Patient-cEntric","dropping-particle":"clinicAl tRial pLatforms)"}],"citation-key":"meyer:2022","container-title":"Pharmaceutical Statistics","DOI":"10.1002/pst.2194","ISSN":"1539-1612","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.

  {"id":"michielsenSinglecellReferenceMapping2022","abstract":"Single-cell genomics is now producing an ever-increasing amount of datasets that, when integrated, could provide large-scale reference atlases of tissue in health as well as disease. Such large-scale atlases not only increase the scale and generalizability of analyses but also enable combining the knowledge generated by individual studies. Specifically, individual studies often differ in terms of cell annotation terminology and depth, with different groups specializing in different cell type compartments, often using distinct terminology. Understanding how these distinct sets of annotations are related and complement each other would mark a major step towards a consensus-based cell type annotation that reflects the latest knowledge in the field. Whereas recent computational techniques, referred to as “reference mapping” methods, facilitate the usage and expansion of existing reference atlases by mapping new datasets (i.e. queries) onto an atlas; a systematic approach towards harmonizing dataset-specific cell type terminology and annotation depth is still lacking. Here, we present “treeArches”, a framework to automatically build and extend reference atlases while enriching them with an updatable hierarchy of cell type annotations across different datasets. We demonstrate various use cases for treeArches, from automatically resolving relations between reference and query cell types to identifying unseen cell types not present in the reference, such as disease-associated cell states. We envision treeArches enabling data-driven construction of consensus, atlas-level cell type hierarchies, as well as facilitating efficient usage of reference atlases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Michielsen","given":"Lieke"},{"family":"Lotfollahi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Strobl","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Sikkema","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Reinders","given":"Marcel J.

F1CDx reports known and likely pathogenic short variants (SVs), copy number alterations (CNAs), and select rearrangements, as well as complex biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI), in addition to genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) in ovarian cancer. CGP services can reduce the complexity of biomarker testing, enabling precision medicine to improve treatment decision-making and outcomes for cancer patients, but only if test results are reliable, accurate, and validated clinically and analytically to the highest standard available. The analyses presented herein demonstrate the extensive analytical and clinical validation supporting the F1CDx initial and subsequent FDA approvals to ensure high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of the data reported. The analytical validation included several in-depth evaluations of F1CDx assay performance including limit of detection (LoD), limit of blank (LoB), precision, and orthogonal concordance for SVs (including base substitutions [SUBs] and insertions/deletions [INDELs]), CNAs (including amplifications and homozygous deletions), genomic rearrangements, and select complex biomarkers. The assay validation of >30,000 test results comprises a considerable and increasing body of evidence that supports the clinical utility of F1CDx to match patients with solid tumors to targeted therapies or immunotherapies based on their tumor’s genomic alterations and biomarkers.

  {"id":"mir_2021","abstract":"Background\n: Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is associated with improved overall and cancer-specific survival. The post-NAC pathological stage has previously been reported to be a major determinant of outcome.\nObjective\n: To develop a postoperative nomogram for survival based on pathological and clinical parameters from an international consortium.\nDesign, setting, and participants\n: Between 2000 and 2015, 1866 patients with MIBC were treated at 19 institutions in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Analysis was limited to 640 patients with adequate follow-up who had received three or more cycles of NAC.\nOutcome measurements and statistical analysis\n: A nomogram for bladder cancer–specific mortality (BCSM) was developed by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Decision curve analysis was used to assess the model’s clinical utility.\nResults and limitations\n: A total of 640 patients were identified. Downstaging to non-MIBC (ypT1, ypTa, and ypTis) occurred in 271 patients (42 %), and 113 (17 %) achieved a complete response (ypT0N0). The 5-yr BCSM was 47.2 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 41.2–52.6 %). On multivariable analysis, covariates with a statistically significant association with BCSM were lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.90 [95% CI: 1.4–2.6]; p < 0.001), positive surgical margins (HR 2.01 [95 % CI: 1.3–2.9]; p < 0.001), and pathological stage (with ypT0/Tis/Ta/T1 as reference: ypT2 [HR 2.77 {95 % CI: 1.7–4.6}; p < 0.001] and ypT3–4 [HR 5.9 {95 % CI: 3.8–9.3}; p < 0.001]). The area under the curve of the model predicting 5-yr BCSM after cross validation with 300 bootstraps was 75.4 % (95 % CI: 68.1–82.6 %). Decision curve analyses showed a modest net benefit for the use of the BCSM nomogram in the current cohort compared with the use of American Joint Committee on Cancer staging alone. Limitations include the retrospective study design and the lack of central pathology.\nConclusions\n: We have developed and internally validated a nomogram predicting BCSM after NAC and radical cystectomy for MIBC.

  {"id":"miscouridouDeepSurvivalAnalysis","abstract":"Clinical care requires understanding the time to medical events. Medical events include the time to a disease like chronic kidney disease progressing or the time to a complication as in stroke for high blood pressure. Models for event times live in the framework provided by survival analysis. We expand on deep survival analysis (Ranganath et al., 2016a), a deep generative model for survival analysis in the presence of missing data, where the survival times are modeled using Weibull distributions. We develop methods to relax the distributional assumptions in deep survival analysis using survival distributions that can approximate any true survival function. We show that the model structure mimics the information-optimal procedure in the presence of missing data. Our experiments demonstrate that moving to ﬂexible survival functions yields better likelihoods and concordances for coronary heart disease prediction from electronic health records.","author":[{"family":"Miscouridou","given":"Xenia"},{"family":"Perotte","given":"Adler"},{"family":"Elhadad","given":"Noemie"},{"family":"Ranganath","given":"Rajesh"}],"citation-key":"miscouridouDeepSurvivalAnalysis","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Deep Survival Analysis: Nonparametrics and Missingness","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"mo_2018","abstract":"Identification of clinically relevant tumor subtypes and omics signatures is an important task in cancer translational research for precision medicine. Large-scale genomic profiling studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have generated vast amounts of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data. While these studies have provided great resources for researchers to discover clinically relevant tumor subtypes and driver molecular alterations, there are few computationally efficient methods and tools for integrative clustering analysis of these multi-type omics data. Therefore, the aim of this article is to develop a fully Bayesian latent variable method (called iClusterBayes) that can jointly model omics data of continuous and discrete data types for identification of tumor subtypes and relevant omics features. Specifically, the proposed method uses a few latent variables to capture the inherent structure of multiple omics data sets to achieve joint dimension reduction. As a result, the tumor samples can be clustered in the latent variable space and relevant omics features that drive the sample clustering are identified through Bayesian variable selection. This method significantly improve on the existing integrative clustering method iClusterPlus in terms of statistical inference and computational speed. By analyzing TCGA and simulated data sets, we demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in revealing clinically meaningful tumor subtypes and driver omics features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Mo","given":"Qianxing"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Ronglai"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Cui"},{"family":"Vannucci","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Keith S"},{"family":"Hilsenbeck","given":"Susan G"}],"citation-key":"mo_2018","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxx017","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"71-86","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"A fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering analysis of multi-type omics data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/19/1/71/3852318","volume":"19"},

Here we describe an extension of the random forest method for building event risk prediction models in survival analysis with competing risks. In case of right-censored data, the event status at the prediction horizon is unknown for some subjects. We propose to replace the censored event status by a jackknife pseudo-value, and then to apply an implementation of random forests for uncensored data. Because the pseudo-responses take on values on a continuous scale, the node variance is chosen as split criterion for growing regression trees. In a simulation study, the pseudo split criterion is compared with the Gini split criterion when the latter is applied to the uncensored event status. To investigate the resulting pseudo random forest method for building risk prediction models, we analyze it in a simulation study of predictive performance where we compare it to Cox regression and random survival forest. The method is further illustrated in two real data sets.

Recently several studies defining subtypes of glioma have been published. Here, we review the statistical considerations of how to build and validate prognostic models, explain the models presented in the current glioma literature, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of each model. The 3 statistical considerations to establishing clinically useful prognostic models are: study design, model building, and validation. Careful study design helps to ensure that the model is unbiased and generalizable to the population of interest. During model building, a discovery cohort of patients can be used to choose variables, construct models, and estimate prediction performance via internal validation. Via external validation, an independent dataset can assess how well the model performs. It is imperative that published models properly detail the study design and methods for both model building and validation. This provides readers the information necessary to assess the bias in a study, compare other published models, and determine the model's clinical usefulness. As editors, reviewers, and readers of the relevant literature, we should be cognizant of the needed statistical considerations and insist on their use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Molinaro","given":"Annette M."},{"family":"Wrensch","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Eckel-Passow","given":"Jeanette E."}],"citation-key":"molinaroStatisticalConsiderationsPrognostic2016","container-title":"Neuro-Oncology","container-title-short":"Neuro-Oncology","DOI":"10.1093/neuonc/nov255","ISSN":"1522-8517","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,1]]},"page":"609-623","source":"Silverchair","title":"Statistical considerations on prognostic models for glioma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/neuonc/nov255","volume":"18"},

Compared to statistical modeling approaches, machine learning makes fewer explicit assumptions about data structures, such as linearity. However, their model parameters usually cannot be easily related to the data generating process. To learn about the modeled relationships, partial dependence (PD) plots and permutation feature importance (PFI) are often used as interpretation methods. However, PD and PFI lack a theory that relates them to the data generating process. We formalize PD and PFI as statistical estimators of ground truth estimands rooted in the data generating process. We show that PD and PFI estimates deviate from this ground truth due to statistical biases, model variance and Monte Carlo approximation errors. To account for model variance in PD and PFI estimation, we propose the learner-PD and the learner-PFI based on model refits, and propose corrected variance and confidence interval estimators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Molnar","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Freiesleben","given":"Timo"},{"family":"König","given":"Gunnar"},{"family":"Casalicchio","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Marvin N."},{"family":"Bischl","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"molnarRelatingPartialDependence2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,3]]},"number":"arXiv:2109.01433","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Relating the Partial Dependence Plot and Permutation Feature Importance to the Data Generating Process","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01433"},

In this work, an R package, SurvBoost, is developed to implement the gradient boosting algorithm for ﬁtting the SPH model with high-dimensional covariate variables and other confounders.

It’s well known that Bayesian analys is has the advantage in dealing with censored data and small sample over freque ntist methods. Therefore in this paper we discuss the PHM for right-censored de ath times from Bayesian perspective, and then compute the Bayesian estimator based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Survival model can be conveniently inspected with the help of hazard function. A common approach to handling the prior probability for the baseline hazard function in PHM is a Gamma process prior. However, this can lead to biased and misl eading results (Spiegelhalte r et al., 1996). The Gibbs sampling is proposed to simulate the Ma rkov chain of parameters’ posterior distribution dynamically, which avoids the ca lculation of complex integrals of the posterior using WinBUGS package. For th e problem, we adopt the idea behind the polygonal baseline hazard approach pr oposed in Beamonte and Bermúdez (2003) to develop the estimation for the surviv al curves.

  {"id":"mu_2022","abstract":"Background: The problem of variable selection for risk factor modeling is an ongoing challenge in statistical practice. Classical methods that select one subset of exploratory risk factors dominate the medical research field. However, this approach has been criticized for not taking into account the uncertainty of the model selection process itself. This limitation can be addressed by a Bayesian model averaging approach: instead of focusing on a single model and a few factors, Bayesian model averaging considers all the models with non-negligible probabilities to make inference. \nMethods: This paper reports on a simulation study designed to emulate a matched case-control study and compares classical versus Bayesian model averaging selection methods. We used Matthews’s correlation coefficient to measure the quality of binary classifications. Both classical and Bayesian model averaging were also applied and compared for the analysis of a matched case-control study of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections after hospital discharge 2011-2013. \nResults: Bayesian model averaging outperformed the classical approach with much lower false positive rates and higher Matthew’s correlation scores. Bayesian model averaging also produced more reliable and robust effect estimates. \nConclusion: Bayesian model averaging is a conceptually simple, unified approach that produces robust results. It can be used to replace controversial P-values for case-control study in medical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Mu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"See","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Edwards","given":"Jonathan R."}],"citation-key":"mu_2022","container-title":"Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Public Health","container-title-short":"ebph","DOI":"10.2427/13048","ISSN":"2282-0930","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,7]]},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian model averaging: improved variable selection for matched case-control studies","title-short":"Bayesian model averaging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://riviste.unimi.it/index.php/ebph/article/view/17280","volume":"16"},

Despite preoperative risk stratification and radical treatment, recurrence and progression are common. Thus, prognostic and monitoring biomarkers are needed. This feasibility study aimed to investigate if targeted analyses on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma could identify tumour-specific gene variants, and thus have potential for further evaluation as a biomarker in UTUC.\nMethods  Nine UTUC patients with genetically characterised tumours were included in this prospective pilot study. Two tumour-specific variants were chosen for targeted analyses with multiplex droplet digital PCR on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma at diagnosis or from recurrence.\nResults  Of six patients with diagnostic plasma samples, ctDNA was detected in four with G2 or G3 tumours and tumours > ­300m2 in size. Three of these patients progressed in their disease and the fourth had the largest G3 tumour at sampling. In contrast, the two patients with undetectable ctDNA in diagnostic plasma had a G1 tumour and G3 carcinoma in situ (CIS), respectively. The patient with G3 CIS had detectable ctDNA later during follow-up and progressed thereafter with aggressive intravesical recurrence and CT-scan-verified CIS progression in the upper urinary tract. In three patients with small recurrent G1 or G2 tumours, none had detectable ctDNA in plasma and all were progression free.\nConclusion  Our early findings demonstrate that ctDNA in plasma can be detected by targeted analysis in patients with UTUC. However, further studies are needed to determine its role as a potential biomarker.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Mu","given":"Ninni"},{"family":"Jylhä","given":"Cecilia"},{"family":"Axelsson","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Sydén","given":"Filip"},{"family":"Brehmer","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Tham","given":"Emma"}],"citation-key":"mu_2023","container-title":"World Journal of Urology","container-title-short":"World J Urol","DOI":"10.1007/s00345-023-04583-w","ISSN":"1433-8726","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3421-3427","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Patient-specific targeted analysis of circulating tumour DNA in plasma is feasible and may be a potential biomarker in UTUC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00345-023-04583-w","volume":"41"},

The difference in restricted mean survival time (dRMST) test is frequently proposed as an alternative to the log-rank under nonproportional hazard scenarios.To compare the log-rank with the MaxCombo and dRMST in immuno-oncology trials to evaluate their performance in practice.Comprehensive literature review using Google Scholar, PubMed, and other sources for randomized clinical trials published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at major clinical conferences before December 2019 assessing efficacy of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 or anti-programmed death/ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies.Pivotal studies with overall survival or progression-free survival as the primary or key secondary end point with a planned statistical comparison in the protocol. Sixty-three studies on anti-programmed cell death protein-1 or anti-programmed death/ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies used as monotherapy or in combination with other agents in 35 902 patients across multiple solid tumor types were identified.Statistical comparisons (n = 150) were made between the 3 tests using the analysis populations as defined in the original protocol of each trial.Nominal significance based on a 2-sided .05-level test was used to evaluate concordance. Case studies featuring different types of nonproportional hazards were used to discuss more robust ways of characterizing treatment benefit instead of sole reliance on hazard ratios.In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 studies including 35 902 patients, between the log-rank and MaxCombo, 135 of 150 comparisons (90%) were concordant; MaxCombo achieved nominal significance in 15 of 15 discordant cases, while log-rank did not. Several cases appeared to have clinically meaningful benefits that would not have been detected using log-rank. Between the log-rank and dRMST tests, 137 of 150 comparisons (91%) were concordant; log-rank was nominally significant in 5 of 13 cases, while dRMST was significant in 8 of 13. Among all 3 tests, 127 comparisons (85%) were concordant.The findings of this review show that MaxCombo may provide a pragmatic alternative to log-rank when departure from proportional hazards is anticipated.

Using prose recall scores from the Swedish OCTO-Twin Longitudinal Study of Aging, we fitted a joint longitudinal-survival model to investigate the association between risk of mortality and individual differences in rates of change in memory. A model describing change in memory scores as following an accelerating decline trajectory and a Weibull survival model was identified as the best fitting. This model adjusted for random effects representing individual variation in initial memory performance and change in rate of decline as linking terms between the longitudinal and survival models. Memory performance and change in rate of memory decline were significant predictors of proximity to death.

Despite many different methods used in clinical trials, few assays have clinical utility as a surrogate endpoint in a limited number of hematologic malignancies. MRD assays for lymphomas are mostly performed in research settings due to lack of harmonized methods, heterogeneity of diseases, and need for a primary tumor sample. We explored the feasibility of a pan hematologic malignancy classifier (“pan heme classifier”) based on GRAIL’s methylation platform as a potential tumor-agnostic plasma-based MRD assay for hematologic malignancies.\n            Methods: First, 428 plasma samples from various hematologic malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and multiple myeloma (MM) were blindly tested retrospectively using the pan heme classifier. The majority of samples (375/428; 88%) were from relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. Cancer signal detection and signal origin prediction were explored at various detection thresholds. Next, sensitivity of the pan heme classifier was evaluated using 74 (22 and 14 unique patients in CLL and MCL, respectively) post-treatment samples with orthogonal methods (flow cytometry in CLL and clonoSEQ in MCL). Finally, dilution experiments were carried out in 4 DLBCL and 4 CLL patient samples.\n            Results: Of 428 samples, 408 (95%) passed quality control. At a prespecified detection threshold, we observed high (91%) cancer detection rate with high cancer signal origin\n            accuracies: 100% in CLL, &gt;98% in MM, &gt;95% in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL, FL, MCL), and 87% in AML samples. As expected, targeting lower detection thresholds resulted in increased cancer-positive calls. Cancer was reproducibly detected in 48 of 54 (89%) cases where paired samples were taken prior to treatment (screening and cycle 1, day 1), demonstrating high biologic reproducibility. Analysis of posttreatment CLL and MCL samples with cell-based orthogonal MRD assays suggests the current assay limit of detection (LOD) is ~10-3-10-4 MVAF (a methylation-based tumor fraction estimate). These data suggest that cancer signal score is strongly correlated to the observed MVAF. Furthermore, serially diluted DLBCL and CLL patient plasma samples were spiked into healthy volunteer plasma samples, suggesting an LOD of 10-4 MVAF.\n            Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the pan heme classifier can identify cancer signal from R/R patients across multiple hematologic malignancies. We are currently working to further optimize the assay’s specificity and sensitivity. These results support the development of a blood-based tumor agnostic methylated ctDNA MRD assay with potential utility in several hematologic indications.\n            Citation Format: Veerendra Munugalavadla, Gary de Jesus, Aleksandra Markovets, Qinwen Liu, Oliver Venn, Rafael White, Giulia Fabbri, Paul Labrousse, Dan Stetson, Brian Dougherty, Darren Hodgson, Jill Walker, Anas Younes, Daniel Auclair.

Using only the last available measurement as a baseline covariate in a survival model for the time to graft failure discards the whole longitudinal evolution. We propose a two-stage approach to handle this type of data sets using all available information. At the first stage, we summarize the longitudinal information with nonlinear mixed-effects model, and at the second stage, we include the Empirical Bayes estimates of the subject-specific parameters as predictors in the Cox model for the time to allograft failure. To take into account that the estimated subject-specific parameters are included in the model, we use a Monte Carlo approach and sample from the posterior distribution of the random effects given the observed data. Our proposal is exemplified on a study of the impact of renal resistance evolution on the graft survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Murawska","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Rizopoulos","given":"Dimitris"},{"family":"Lesaffre","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"murawskaTwoStageJointModel2012","container-title":"Journal of Probability and Statistics","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/194194","genre":"Research Article","ISSN":"1687-952X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e194194","publisher":"Hindawi","title":"A Two-Stage Joint Model for Nonlinear Longitudinal Response and a Time-to-Event with Application in Transplantation Studies","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jps/2012/194194/","volume":"2012"},
  {"id":"murdochDefinitionsMethodsApplications2019","abstract":"Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Murdoch","given":"W.

  {"id":"murrayCausalSurvivalAnalysis2021","abstract":"When reporting results from randomized experiments, researchers often choose to present a per-protocol effect in addition to an intention-to-treat effect. However, these per-protocol effects are often described retrospectively, for example, comparing outcomes among individuals who adhered to their assigned treatment strategy throughout the study. This retrospective definition of a per-protocol effect is often confounded and cannot be interpreted causally because it encounters treatment-confounder feedback loops, where past confounders affect future treatment, and current treatment affects future confounders. Per-protocol effects estimated using this method are highly susceptible to the placebo paradox, also called the “healthy adherers” bias, where individuals who adhere to placebo appear to have better survival than those who don’t. This result is generally not due to a benefit of placebo, but rather is most often the result of uncontrolled confounding. Here, we aim to provide an overview to causal inference for survival outcomes with time-varying exposures for static interventions using inverse probability weighting. The basic concepts described here can also apply to other types of exposure strategies, although these may require additional design or analytic considerations.

  {"id":"nagasakiVarietyExhaustedCells2022","abstract":"In T-cell biology, ‘exhaustion’ was initially described as a hyporesponsive state in CD8+ T cells during chronic infections. Recently, exhaustion has been recognized as a T-cell dysfunctional state in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The term ‘exhaustion’ is used mainly to refer to effector T cells with a reduced capacity to secrete cytokines and an increased expression of inhibitory receptors. The up-regulation of exhaustion-related inhibitory receptors, including programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), in such T cells has been associated with the development of tumors, prompting the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors. In addition to CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, including the regulatory T (Treg) cell subset, perform a wide variety of functions within the adaptive immune system. Up-regulation of the same inhibitory receptors that are associated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion has also been identified in CD4+ T cells in chronic infections and cancers, suggesting a similar CD4+ T-cell exhaustion phenotype. For instance, high expression of PD-1 has been observed in Treg cells in the TME, and such Treg cells can play an important role in the resistance to PD-1 blockade therapies. Furthermore, recent progress in single-cell RNA sequencing has shown that CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity are also vulnerable to exhaustion. In this review, we will discuss novel insights into various exhausted T-cell subsets, which could reveal novel therapeutic targets and strategies to induce a robust anti-tumor immune response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Nagasaki","given":"Joji"},{"family":"Togashi","given":"Yosuke"}],"citation-key":"nagasakiVarietyExhaustedCells2022","container-title":"International Immunology","container-title-short":"International Immunology","DOI":"10.1093/intimm/dxac013","ISSN":"1460-2377","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,1]]},"page":"563-570","source":"Silverchair","title":"A variety of ‘exhausted’ T cells in the tumor microenvironment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/intimm/dxac013","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"nakamura:2024","abstract":"180\nBackground: A considerable number of patients with stage II-III colon cancer experience disease recurrence following definitive treatment while others may receive unnecessary toxicity from adjuvant chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection through ctDNA analysis can be evaluated without reliance on tissue which comes with logistic advantages and may be the only option for patients with limited tumor specimens. Methods: COSMOS-CRC-01 is an ongoing biomarker study that enrolled patients with resectable stage 0-III colorectal cancer between January 2020 and April 2021. Plasma samples and clinical data were collected 28 days post-operatively and every 3-6 months for up to 5 years alongside radiographic imaging. Samples were tested on the Guardant Reveal Infinity Oncology Platform for MRD detection. This analytically validated multiomic NGS assay interrogates >700 genes and ~15Mb of methylated regions. A bioinformatics algorithm trained for CRC detection classifies each sample as ctDNA detectable or undetectable based on a predefined statistical likelihood threshold and returns quantitative tumor fraction. The primary endpoint was time to recurrence (TTR) based on ctDNA detection status. Results: This subgroup analysis evaluated 801 post-surgical plasma samples (4mL each, median input 19ng, 96% passed QC) from 136 patients with R0 resected stage II-III colon cancer with a median follow-up of 28 months. ctDNA detection at Day 28 post-surgery and following adjuvant chemotherapy were both associated with significantly shorter TTR (p<0.0001; Table). Sensitivity with serial measurement was 80% (95% CI, 56.3-94.3%), with a median lead time of 5.3 months. Sensitivity was highest for detection of locoregional (2/2), brain (1/1), liver (7/7), or multiple (3/3) metastasis compared to isolated lung (2/4) or peritoneal (1/3) metastasis. Tumor fraction increased as expected in samples collected closer to the time of radiographic detection. Three recurred patients had KRAS G12C variants detected in ctDNA prior to recurrence, suggesting the potential of early intervention with targeted agents. Among 553 post-treatment samples from 114 non-recurred patients, sample specificity was 97.3% (95% CI 95.6-98.5%). Conclusions: We show a plasma-only genomic- and methylation-based assay to have sensitive and specific detection of MRD in stage II-III colon cancer.

Most molecular residual disease (MRD) assays require prior tissue testing to guide ctDNA analysis, resulting in lengthy time to initial results and unevaluable patients. Patients and Methods: We assessed a tissue-free assay (Guardant Reveal) that bioinformatically evaluates &gt;20,000 epigenomic regions for ctDNA detection in 1,977 longitudinally collected post-operative plasma samples from 342 patients with resected colorectal cancer (CRC). Results: We observed sensitive and specific detection of MRD associated with clinically meaningful differences in recurrence-free interval at each timepoint evaluated with a median lead time of 5.3 months. Longitudinal sensitivity in stage II or higher colon cancer was 81%. Sensitivity increased with serial measurement and varied by recurrence site: higher for liver (100%) versus lung (53%) and peritoneal (40%).

  {"id":"narisetty:2020","abstract":"High-dimensional data, where the number of features or covariates can even be larger than the number of independent samples, are ubiquitous and are encountered on a regular basis by statistical scientists both in academia and in industry. A majority of the classical research in statistics dealt with the settings where there is a small number of covariates. Due to the modern advancements in data storage and computational power, the high-dimensional data revolution has significantly occupied mainstream statistical research. In gene expression datasets, for instance, it is not uncommon to encounter datasets with observations on at most a few hundred independent samples (subjects) and with information on tens or hundreds of thousands of genes per each sample. An important and common question that arises quickly is—“which of the available covariates are relevant to the outcome of interest?” This concerns the problem of variable selection (and more generally model selection) in statistics and data science. This chapter will provide an overview of some of the most well-known model selection methods along with some of the more recent methods. While frequentist methods will be discussed, Bayesian approaches will be given a more elaborate treatment. The frequentist framework for model selection is primarily based on penalization, whereas the Bayesian framework relies on prior distributions for inducing shrinkage and sparsity. The chapter treats the Bayesian framework in the light of objective and empirical Bayesian viewpoints as the priors in the high-dimensional setting are typically not completely based subjective prior beliefs. An important practical aspect of high-dimensional model selection methods is computational scalability which will also be discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Narisetty","given":"Naveen Naidu"}],"citation-key":"narisetty:2020","collection-title":"Principles and Methods for Data Science","container-title":"Handbook of Statistics","DOI":"10.1016/bs.host.2019.08.001","editor":[{"family":"Srinivasa Rao","given":"Arni S.

  {"id":"neath:1997","abstract":"Although classical statistical methods are inapplicable in point estimation problems involving nonidentifiable parameters, a Bayesian analysis using proper priors can produce a closed form, interpretable point estimate in such problems. The question of whether, and when, the Bayesian approach produces worthwhile answers is investigated. In contrast to the preposterior analysis of this question offered by Kadane, we examine the question conditionally, given the information provided by the experiment. An important initial insight on the matter is that posterior estimates of a nonidentifiable parameter can actually be inferior to the prior (no-data) estimate of that parameter, even as the sample size grows to infinity. In general, our goal is to characterize, within the space of prior distributions, classes of priors that lead to posterior estimates that are superior, in some reasonable sense, to one's prior estimate. This goal is shown to be feasible through a detailed examination of a particular two-parameter Binomial model. Our results support the proposition that a Bayesian analysis tends to be efficacious in the estimation problem studied, and suggest that Bayesian updating can produce useful answers in the presence of nonidentifiability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Neath","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Samaniego","given":"Francisco J."}],"citation-key":"neath:1997","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.1997.10473967","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",8,1]]},"page":"225-232","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"On the Efficacy of Bayesian Inference for Nonidentifiable Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1997.10473967","volume":"51"},

HRMSMs allow investigators to analyze the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome based on a fixed, shorter and user-specified history of exposure compared to MSMs. By default, the latter represent the treatment causal effect of interest based on a treatment history defined by the treatments assigned between the study's start and outcome collection. We lay out in this article the formal statistical framework behind HRMSMs. Beyond allowing a more flexible causal analysis, HRMSMs improve computational tractability and mitigate statistical power concerns when designing longitudinal studies. We also develop three consistent estimators of HRMSM parameters under sufficient model assumptions: the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted (IPTW), G-computation and Double Robust (DR) estimators. In addition, we show that the assumptions commonly adopted for identification and consistent estimation of MSM parameters (existence of counterfactuals, consistency, time-ordering and sequential randomization assumptions) also lead to identification and consistent estimation of HRMSM parameters.\n\nPublished in: Electronic Journal of Statistics 2007, Vol. 1, 119-154","author":[{"family":"Neugebauer","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Van Der Laan","given":"Mark J"},{"family":"Joffe","given":"Marshall M"},{"family":"Tager","given":"Ira B"}],"citation-key":"Neugebauer2007","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Library","title":"Causal inference in longitudinal studies with history-restricted marginal structural models","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1270v1","volume":"math.ST"},
  {"id":"neumsImprovingSurvivalPrediction2020","abstract":"The accurate prediction of a cancer patient's risk of progression or death can guide clinicians in the selection of treatment and help patients in planning personal affairs. Predictive models based on patient-level data represent a tool for determining risk. Ideally, predictive models will use multiple sources of data (e.g., clinical, demographic, molecular, etc.). However, there are many challenges associated with data integration, such as overfitting and redundant features. In this paper we aim to address those challenges through the development of a novel feature selection and feature reduction framework that can handle correlated data. Our method begins by computing a survival distance score for gene expression, which in combination with a score for clinical independence, results in the selection of highly predictive genes that are non-redundant with clinical features. The survival distance score is a measure of variation of gene expression over time, weighted by the variance of the gene expression over all patients. Selected genes, in combination with clinical data, are used to build a predictive model for survival. We benchmark our approach against commonly used methods, namely lasso- as well as ridge-penalized Cox proportional hazards models, using three publicly available cancer data sets: kidney cancer (521 samples), lung cancer (454 samples) and bladder cancer (335 samples). Across all data sets, our approach built on the training set outperformed the clinical data alone in the test set in terms of predictive power with a c.Index of 0.773 vs 0.755 for kidney cancer, 0.695 vs 0.664 for lung cancer and 0.648 vs 0.636 for bladder cancer. Further, we were able to show increased predictive performance of our method compared to lasso-penalized models fit to both gene expression and clinical data, which had a c.Index of 0.767, 0.677, and 0.645, as well as increased or comparable predictive power compared to ridge models, which had a c.Index of 0.773, 0.668 and 0.650 for the kidney, lung, and bladder cancer data sets, respectively. Therefore, our score for clinical independence improves prognostic performance as compared to modeling approaches that do not consider combining non-redundant data. Future work will concentrate on optimizing the survival distance score in order to achieve improved results for all types of cancer.","author":[{"family":"Neums","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Koestler","given":"Devin C."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Jeffrey A."}],"citation-key":"neumsImprovingSurvivalPrediction2020","container-title":"Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.

  {"id":"newcomerMeasuringAirflowPortable2019","abstract":"The portable high-efficiency air filtration (PHEAF) device is an engineering control common to the environmental remediation industry. Damage to the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter (e.g., filtration media, gasket), improper installation of the filter into the mounting frame, or defects in the filtration housing affect the capture efficiency of the device. PHEAF devices operating at less than marketed efficiencies justify periodic leak testing of the PHEAF device, especially when the filtered air is exhausted into occupied spaces. A leak test is accomplished by injecting a known concentration of aerosol upstream of the HEPA filter and measuring the percentage of aerosol penetrating through the filtration system. The test protocol scripted for stationary systems (i.e., biological safety cabinets) states that upstream concentrations can be empirically determined using the aerosol photometer to measure particulate matter (PM) in the airstream. This practice requires a homogenous mixture of the aerosol challenge agent within the airstream. However, design of the PHEAF device does not include a validated induction point for the aerosol. Absent of an acceptable means to achieve a homogenous mixture for upstream measurement, the aerosol concentration is mathematically derived based on the measured air volume passing through the PHEAF equipment. In this study, intake volume and exhaust volume for each PHEAF device were measured by either the balometer or the hot wire anemometer. Variability of measurements was examined by instrument and sample location (intake vs. exhaust) to understand which combination would be most consistent for measuring airflow volume. From this study, the authors conclude that the balometer is preferred compared with the hot wire anemometer for measuring airflow through the PHEAF device. Exhaust measurement by balometer seems more reliable than intake measurements by hot wire anemometer.Implications: Although testing of PHEAF devices is recommended by various public health authorities, no nationally recognized test protocol has been published in the United States. In support of measuring the performance of the PHEAF device in a field setting, this study evaluated the hot wire anemometer and balometer techniques and sample locations (intake vs. exhaust) to reliably measure airflow through the PHEAF device. Since accuracy of the particle measurement is associated with airflow volume, it is essential to obtain a true airflow reading. This study suggests that the balometer was more consistent in measuring airflow through the PHEAF device.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Newcomer","given":"Derek A."},{"family":"LaPuma","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Brandys","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Northcross","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"}],"citation-key":"newcomerMeasuringAirflowPortable2019","container-title":"Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association","DOI":"10.1080/10962247.2019.1576554","ISSN":"1096-2247","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,3]]},"license":"All rights reserved","number":"6","page":"734-742","PMID":"30698506","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Measuring airflow through the portable high-efficiency air filtration (PHEAF) device to assess reliability of instrument and sample location","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2019.1576554","volume":"69"},

  {"id":"nguforMixedEffectMachine2019","abstract":"Accurate and reliable prediction of clinical progression over time has the potential to improve the outcomes of chronic disease. The classical approach to analyzing longitudinal data is to use (generalized) linear mixed-effect models (GLMM). However, linear parametric models are predicated on assumptions, which are often difficult to verify. In contrast, data-driven machine learning methods can be applied to derive insight from the raw data without a priori assumptions. However, the underlying theory of most machine learning algorithms assume that the data is independent and identically distributed, making them inefficient for longitudinal supervised learning. In this study, we formulate an analytic framework, which integrates the random-effects structure of GLMM into non-linear machine learning models capable of exploiting temporal heterogeneous effects, sparse and varying-length patient characteristics inherent in longitudinal data. We applied the derived mixed-effect machine learning (MEml) framework to predict longitudinal change in glycemic control measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among well controlled adults with type 2 diabetes. Results show that MEml is competitive with traditional GLMM, but substantially outperformed standard machine learning models that do not account for random-effects. Specifically, the accuracy of MEml in predicting glycemic change at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th clinical visits in advanced was 1.04, 1.08, 1.11, and 1.14 times that of the gradient boosted model respectively, with similar results for the other methods. To further demonstrate the general applicability of MEml, a series of experiments were performed using real publicly available and synthetic data sets for accuracy and robustness. These experiments reinforced the superiority of MEml over the other methods. Overall, results from this study highlight the importance of modeling random-effects in machine learning approaches based on longitudinal data. Our MEml method is highly resistant to correlated data, readily accounts for random-effects, and predicts change of a longitudinal clinical outcome in real-world clinical settings with high accuracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ngufor","given":"Che"},{"family":"Van Houten","given":"Holly"},{"family":"Caffo","given":"Brian S."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Nilay D."},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Rozalina G."}],"citation-key":"nguforMixedEffectMachine2019","container-title":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbi.2018.09.001","ISSN":"1532-0464","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"56-67","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mixed effect machine learning: A framework for predicting longitudinal change in hemoglobin A1c","title-short":"Mixed effect machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046418301758","volume":"89"},

A number of techniques are used to represent knowledge graphs, but often machine learning methods are used to construct a low-dimensional representation that can support many different applications. This representation is designed to preserve a knowledge graph’s local and/or global structure. Additional machine learning methods can be applied to this representation to make predictions within genomic, pharmaceutical, and clinical domains.

Because the computational part of data analysis ultimately identifies shape characteristics in the organization of data sets, the mathematics of shape recognition in high dimensions continues to be a crucial part of data analysis. This article introduces a method that extracts information from high-throughput microarray data and, by using topology, provides greater depth of information than current analytic techniques. The method, termed Progression Analysis of Disease (PAD), first identifies robust aspects of cluster analysis, then goes deeper to find a multitude of biologically meaningful shape characteristics in these data. Additionally, because PAD incorporates a visualization tool, it provides a simple picture or graph that can be used to further explore these data. Although PAD can be applied to a wide range of high-throughput data types, it is used here as an example to analyze breast cancer transcriptional data. This identified a unique subgroup of Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers that express high levels of c-MYB and low levels of innate inflammatory genes. These patients exhibit 100% survival and no metastasis. No supervised step beyond distinction between tumor and healthy patients was used to identify this subtype. The group has a clear and distinct, statistically significant molecular signature, it highlights coherent biology but is invisible to cluster methods, and does not fit into the accepted classification of Luminal A/B, Normal-like subtypes of ER+ breast cancers.

A mechanistic model was developed on the basis of two intrinsic mechanisms of metastatic progression: growth (parameter ������) and dissemination (parameter ������). Population statistical distributions of the parameters were inferred using mixed-effects modeling. A random survival forest analysis was used to select a minimal set of 5 covariates with best predictive power. These were further considered to individually predict the model parameters, by using a backward selection approach. Predictive performances were compared to classical Cox regression and machine learning algorithms.\nResults: The mechanistic model was able to accurately fit the data. Covariate analysis revealed statistically significant association of Ki67 expression with ������ (p=0.001) and EGFR with ������ (p=0.009). Achieving a c-index of 0.65 (0.60-0.71), the model had similar predictive performance as the random survival forest (c-index 0.66-0.69) and Cox regression (c-index 0.62 - 0.67), as well as machine learning classification algorithms.\nConclusion: By providing informative estimates of the invisible metastatic burden at the time of diagnosis and forward simulations of metastatic growth, the proposed model could be used as a personalized prediction tool of help for routine management of breast cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Nicolò","given":"C"},{"family":"Périer","given":"C"},{"family":"Prague","given":"M"},{"family":"Bellera","given":"C"},{"family":"MacGrogan","given":"G"},{"family":"Saut","given":"O"},{"family":"Benzekry","given":"S"}],"citation-key":"nicoloMachineLearningMechanistic","language":"en","page":"38","source":"Zotero","title":"Machine learning and mechanistic modeling for prediction of metastatic relapse in early-stage breast cancer","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"niculescu-mizilObtainingCalibratedProbabilities","abstract":"Boosted decision trees typically yield good accuracy, precision, and ROC area. However, because the outputs from boosting are not well calibrated posterior probabilities, boosting yields poor squared error and cross-entropy. We empirically demonstrate why AdaBoost predicts distorted probabilities and examine three calibration methods for correcting this distortion: Platt Scaling, Isotonic Regression, and Logistic Correction. We also experiment with boosting using log-loss instead of the usual exponential loss. Experiments show that Logistic Correction and boosting with log-loss work well when boosting weak models such as decision stumps, but yield poor performance when boosting more complex models such as full decision trees. Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, however, significantly improve the probabilities predicted by both boosted stumps and boosted trees. After calibration, boosted full decision trees predict better probabilities than other learning methods such as SVMs, neural nets, bagged decision trees, and KNNs, even after these methods are calibrated.","author":[{"family":"Niculescu-Mizil","given":"Alexandru"},{"family":"Caruana","given":"Rich"}],"citation-key":"niculescu-mizilObtainingCalibratedProbabilities","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Obtaining Calibrated Probabilities from Boosting","type":"article-journal"},

We generated a single-cell tumor immune atlas, jointly analyzing published data sets of >500,000 cells from 217 patients and 13 cancer types, providing the basis for a patient stratification based on immune cell compositions. Projecting immune cells from external tumors onto the atlas facilitated an automated cell annotation system. To enable in situ mapping of immune populations for digital pathology, we applied SPOTlight, combining single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data and identifying colocalization patterns of immune, stromal, and cancer cells in tumor sections.

However, this method does not directly integrate with existing Shapley-based interpretations. We close this gap by proposing a Shapley variable importance cloud that pools information across good models to avoid biased assessments in SHAP analyses of final models, and communicate the findings via novel visualizations.

Causality research can generally be divided into two main branches, that is, causal discovery and causal inference. The former focuses on obtaining causal knowledge directly from observational data. The latter aims to estimate the impact deriving from a change of a certain variable over an outcome of interest. This article aims at covering several methodologies that have been developed for both tasks. This survey does not only focus on theoretical aspects.

  {"id":"normington:2020","abstract":"To reduce a clinical trial's cost and ethical risk to its enrollees, some oncology trial designers have suggested borrowing information from similar but already completed trials to reduce the number of patients needed for the current study. Motivated by competing drug therapies for lymphoma, we propose a Bayesian adaptive “platform” trial design that uses commensurate prior methods at interim analyses to borrow adaptively from the control group of an earlier-starting trial. The design adjusts the trial's randomization ratio in favor of the novel treatment when the interim posterior indicates commensurability of the two control groups. In this setting, our design can supplement a control arm with historical data, and randomize more new patients to the novel treatments. This design is both ethical and economical, since it shortens the process of introducing new treatments into the market, and any additional costs introduced by this design will be compensated by the savings in control arm sizes. Our approach performs well via simulation across settings with varying degrees of commensurability and true treatment effects, and compares favorably to an adaptive “all-or-nothing” approach in which the decision to pool or discard historical controls is based on a simple ad-hoc frequentist test at interim analysis. We also consider a three drug extension where a new imaginary intervention joins the platform, and show again that our procedure performs well via simulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Normington","given":"James"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jiawen"},{"family":"Mattiello","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Sarkar","given":"Somnath"},{"family":"Carlin","given":"Brad"}],"citation-key":"normington:2020","container-title":"Contemporary Clinical Trials","container-title-short":"Contemporary Clinical Trials","DOI":"10.1016/j.cct.2019.105890","ISSN":"1551-7144","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,1]]},"page":"105890","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An efficient Bayesian platform trial design for borrowing adaptively from historical control data in lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714419306056","volume":"89"},

Recently, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly adopted for this purpose. However, only a few studies have compared the performances between CPH and ML models. This study aimed at comparing CPH with two state-of-the-art ML algorithms, namely, conditional survival forest (CSF) and DeepSurv for disease progression prediction in NPC. Methods: From January 2010 to March 2013, 412 eligible NPC patients were reviewed. The entire dataset was split into training cohort and testing cohort in a ratio of 90%:10%. Ten features from patient-related, disease-related, and treatment-related data were used to train the models for progression-free survival (PFS) prediction. The model performance was compared using the concordance index (c-index), Brier score, and log-rank test based on the risk stratification results. Results: DeepSurv (c-index = 0.68, Brier score = 0.13, log-rank test p = 0.02) achieved the best performance compared to CSF (c-index = 0.63, Brier score = 0.14, log-rank test p = 0.38) and CPH (c-index = 0.57, Brier score = 0.15, log-rank test p = 0.81).

Based on the total number of allele copies at the genomic locations in the tumor subclones, the problem is viewed from two perspectives: the presence or absence of copy-neutrality assumption. With the presence of copy-neutrality, it is assumed that the genome contains mutational variability and the three possible genotypes may be present at each genomic location. As such, the genotypes of all the genomic locations in the tumor subclones are modeled by a ternary matrix. In the second case, in addition to mutational variability, it is assumed that the genomic locations may be affected by structural variabilities such as copy number variation (CNV). Thus, the genotypes are modeled with a pair of (Q + 1)-ary matrices. Using the categorical Indian buffet process (cIBP), state-space modeling framework is employed in describing the two processes and the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for dynamic models are applied to perform inference on important model parameters. Moreover, the problem of estimating gene regulatory network (GRN) from measurement with missing values is presented. Specifically, gene expression time series data may contain missing values for entire expression values of a single point or some set of consecutive time points. However, complete data is often needed to make inference on the underlying GRN. Using the missing measurement, a dynamic stochastic model is used to describe the evolution of gene expression and point-based Gaussian approximation (PBGA) filters with one-step or two-step missing measurements are applied for the inference. Finally, the problem of deconvolving gene expression data from complex heterogeneous biological samples is examined, where the observed data are a mixture of different cell types. A statistical description of the problem is used and the SMC method for static models is applied to estimate the cell-type specific expressions and the cell type proportions in the heterogeneous samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Ogundijo","given":"Oyetunji Enoch"}],"citation-key":"ogundijo_2019","DOI":"10.7916/D8-M5S8-9J40","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"[object Object]","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian Inference for Genomic Data Analysis","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/d8-m5s8-9j40"},

The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically performed in “bulk,” and the data represent an average of gene expression patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Olsen","given":"Thale Kristin"},{"family":"Baryawno","given":"Ninib"}],"citation-key":"olsenIntroductionSingleCellRNA2018","container-title":"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cpmb.57","ISSN":"1934-3647","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","page":"e57","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Introduction to Single-Cell RNA Sequencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpmb.57","volume":"122"},

Defining an appropriate risk threshold to recommend intervention is a key challenge in bringing a risk prediction model to clinical application; such risk thresholds are often defined in an ad hoc way. This is problematic because tacitly assumed costs of false positive and false negative classifications may not be clinically sensible. For example, when choosing the risk threshold that maximizes the proportion of patients correctly classified, false positives and false negatives are assumed equally costly. Furthermore, small to moderate sample sizes may lead to unstable optimal thresholds, which requires a particularly cautious interpretation of results.\n            \n            \n              Main text\n              We discuss how three common myths about risk thresholds often lead to inappropriate risk stratification of patients. First, we point out the contexts of counseling and shared decision-making in which a continuous risk estimate is more useful than risk stratification. Second, we argue that threshold selection should reflect the consequences of the decisions made following risk stratification. Third, we emphasize that there is usually no universally optimal threshold but rather that a plausible risk threshold depends on the clinical context. Consequently, we recommend to present results for multiple risk thresholds when developing or validating a prediction model.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Bearing in mind these three considerations can avoid inappropriate allocation (and non-allocation) of interventions.

In this article, we focus on the application of joint models on clinical trial data with special interest in the treatment effect on the survival outcome. Within a joint model, the estimated treatment effect on the survival outcome is an aggregate comprising the indirect treatment effect through the longitudinal outcome and the direct treatment effect on the survival outcome. This overall treatment effect is, however, conditional on random effects, and therefore has a subject-specific interpretation. The conditional interpretation arises from the shared random effects between the longitudinal and survival process in combination with the nonlinear link function of the survival model. The overall treatment effect is, therefore, not valid for population-based inference, which is the goal for most clinical trials. We propose a method to obtain a marginal estimate of the overall treatment effect on the survival outcome in a joint model. Additionally, we extend our proposal to allow for different parameterizations for the association between the longitudinal and survival outcome. The proposed method is demonstrated on data of a clinical study on the effect of synbiotic on the gut microbiota of cesarean delivered infants, where we estimate the marginal overall treatment effect on the risk of eczema or atopic dermatitis using longitudinal information on fecal bifidobacteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Oudenhoven","given":"Floor M.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Swinkels","given":"Sophie H.

  {"id":"paigeLandmarkModelsOptimizing2018","abstract":"The benefits of using electronic health records (EHRs) for disease risk screening and personalized health-care decisions are being increasingly recognized. Here we present a computationally feasible statistical approach with which to address the methodological challenges involved in utilizing historical repeat measures of multiple risk factors recorded in EHRs to systematically identify patients at high risk of future disease. The approach is principally based on a 2-stage dynamic landmark model. The first stage estimates current risk factor values from all available historical repeat risk factor measurements via landmark-age–specific multivariate linear mixed-effects models with correlated random intercepts, which account for sporadically recorded repeat measures, unobserved data, and measurement errors. The second stage predicts future disease risk from a sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with estimated current risk factor values from the first stage. We exemplify these methods by developing and validating a dynamic 10-year cardiovascular disease risk prediction model using primary-care EHRs for age, diabetes status, hypertension treatment, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in 41,373 persons from 10 primary-care practices in England and Wales contributing to The Health Improvement Network (1997–2016).

  {"id":"pak_2021","abstract":"Objectives\nPrior studies have shown that pathologic complete response at radical cystectomy, a significant prognostic factor, can be attributed to both neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and high-quality transurethral resections (TURBT) prior to NAC. It remains unclear whether the visual completeness of TURBT prior to NAC plays an important role in subsequent outcomes. We sought to assess the association of completeness of TURBT prior to NAC with response and survival outcomes.\nMethods and Materials\nWe retrospectively reviewed all patients with clinically localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer at our institution who received NAC from 2000 to 2017. Complete TURBT was defined as resection of all visible tumor in entirety, resection to normal-appearing muscle, and/or repeat pre-NAC TURBT revealing cT0. Patients who were restaged as cT0 after NAC and refused cystectomy were placed on an active surveillance/delayed intervention (ASDI) protocol. The primary endpoints were overall and cancer-specific survival. The secondary endpoints were recurrence-free and muscle-invasive recurrence-free survival.\nResults\nOf 93 patients, 62 (67%) underwent complete TURBT prior to chemotherapy. Compared to patients with incomplete TURBT, those with complete TURBT had lower rates of variant histology (13% vs. 32%) and hydronephrosis (15% vs. 39%). Also, 36% of patients with incomplete TURBT had ≥cT3 disease prior to NAC, compared to none in the complete TURBT cohort. Patients with complete TURBT were more likely to defer RC and pursue ASDI (61% vs. 32%). Those with complete TURBT had lower rates of pT2 or higher disease at cystectomy (48% vs. 75%), with a lower rate of N+ disease trending towards significance (17% vs. 37%). Patients with complete TURBT had higher 5-year overall (77% vs. 46%, P = 0.003) and cancer-specific (85% vs. 50%, P = 0.001) survival. On Cox regression analysis, complete TURBT was significantly associated with superior cancer-specific, recurrence-free, and muscle-invasive recurrence-free survival.\nConclusions\nA complete TURBT prior to NAC is associated with improved survival and oncologic outcomes in this cohort with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The extent to which complete TURBT simply represents a proxy for less aggressive disease or is actually a beneficial therapeutic intervention which improves response to chemotherapy is difficult to define retrospectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pak","given":"Jamie S"},{"family":"Haas","given":"Christopher R"},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Christopher B"},{"family":"DeCastro","given":"G Joel"},{"family":"Benson","given":"Mitchell C"},{"family":"McKiernan","given":"James M"}],"citation-key":"pak_2021","container-title":"Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations","container-title-short":"Urologic Oncology: Seminars and Original Investigations","DOI":"10.1016/j.urolonc.2021.03.025","ISSN":"1078-1439","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"787.e9-787.e15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Survival and oncologic outcomes of complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078143921001356","volume":"39"},

In an era of personalized medicine, these decisions should be based on the predicted benefit of a treatment on a patient-level. Survival prediction models play a central role as they incorporate the time-to-event and censoring. In medical applications uncertainty is critical especially when treatments differ in their side effect profiles or costs. Additionally, models must be adapted to local populations without diminishing performance and often without the original training data available due to privacy concern. Both points are supported by Bayesian models—yet they are rarely used. The aim of this work is to evaluate Bayesian parametric survival models on public datasets including cardiology, infectious diseases, and oncology.\n            \n            \n              Materials and methods\n              Bayesian parametric survival models based on the Exponential and Weibull distribution were implemented as a Python package. A linear combination and a neural network were used for predicting the parameters of the distributions. A superiority design was used to assess whether Bayesian models are better than commonly used models such as Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest, and Neural Network-based Cox Proportional Hazards. In a secondary analysis, overfitting was compared between these models. An equivalence design was used to assess whether the prediction performance of Bayesian models after model updating using Bayes rule is equivalent to retraining on the full dataset.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In this study, we found that Bayesian parametric survival models perform as good as state-of-the art models while requiring less hyperparameters to be tuned and providing a measure of the uncertainty of the predictions.

In an era of personalized medicine, these decisions should be based on the predicted benefit of a treatment on a patient-level. Survival prediction models play a central role as they incorporate the time-to-event and censoring. In medical applications uncertainty is critical especially when treatments differ in their side effect profiles or costs. Additionally, models must be adapted to local populations without diminishing performance and often without the original training data available due to privacy concern. Both points are supported by Bayesian models—yet they are rarely used. The aim of this work is to evaluate Bayesian parametric survival models on public datasets including cardiology, infectious diseases, and oncology.\n            \n            \n              Materials and methods\n              Bayesian parametric survival models based on the Exponential and Weibull distribution were implemented as a Python package. A linear combination and a neural network were used for predicting the parameters of the distributions. A superiority design was used to assess whether Bayesian models are better than commonly used models such as Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest, and Neural Network-based Cox Proportional Hazards.

  {"id":"parikhMachineLearningApproach2021","abstract":"Background Identifying individuals at risk for future hospitalization or death has been a major priority of population health management strategies. High-risk individuals are a heterogeneous group, and existing studies describing heterogeneity in high-risk individuals have been limited by data focused on clinical comorbidities and not socioeconomic or behavioral factors. We used machine learning clustering methods and linked comorbidity-based, sociodemographic, and psychobehavioral data to identify subgroups of high-risk Veterans and study long-term outcomes, hypothesizing that factors other than comorbidities would characterize several subgroups. Methods and findings In this cross-sectional study, we used data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository of VA administrative claims and electronic health data. To identify high-risk Veterans, we used the Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score, a routinely-used VA model that predicts a patient’s percentile risk of hospitalization or death at one year. Our study population consisted of 110,000 Veterans who were randomly sampled from 1,920,436 Veterans with a CAN score≥75th percentile in 2014. We categorized patient-level data into 119 independent variables based on demographics, comorbidities, pharmacy, vital signs, laboratories, and prior utilization. We used a previously validated density-based clustering algorithm to identify 30 subgroups of high-risk Veterans ranging in size from 50 to 2,446 patients. Mean CAN score ranged from 72.4 to 90.3 among subgroups. Two-year mortality ranged from 0.9% to 45.6% and was highest in the home-based care and metastatic cancer subgroups. Mean inpatient days ranged from 1.4 to 30.5 and were highest in the post-surgery and blood loss anemia subgroups. Mean emergency room visits ranged from 1.0 to 4.3 and were highest in the chronic sedative use and polysubstance use with amphetamine predominance subgroups. Five subgroups were distinguished by psychobehavioral factors and four subgroups were distinguished by sociodemographic factors. Conclusions High-risk Veterans are a heterogeneous population consisting of multiple distinct subgroups–many of which are not defined by clinical comorbidities–with distinct utilization and outcome patterns. To our knowledge, this represents the largest application of ML clustering methods to subgroup a high-risk population. Further study is needed to determine whether distinct subgroups may benefit from individualized interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Parikh","given":"Ravi B."},{"family":"Linn","given":"Kristin A."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Maciejewski","given":"Matthew L."},{"family":"Rosland","given":"Ann-Marie"},{"family":"Volpp","given":"Kevin G."},{"family":"Groeneveld","given":"Peter W."},{"family":"Navathe","given":"Amol S."}],"citation-key":"parikhMachineLearningApproach2021","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0247203","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e0247203","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A machine learning approach to identify distinct subgroups of veterans at risk for hospitalization or death using administrative and electronic health record data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247203","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"parkModelSelectionDiagnostics2014","abstract":"Comparison of two hazard rate functions is important for evaluating treatment effect in studies concerning times to some important events. In practice, it may happen that the two hazard rate functions cross each other at one or more unknown time points, representing temporal changes of the treatment effect. Also, besides survival data, there could be longitudinal data available regarding some time-dependent covariates. When jointly modeling the survival and longitudinal data in such cases, model selection and model diagnostics are especially important to provide reliable statistical analysis of the data, which are lacking in the literature. In this paper, we discuss several criteria for assessing model fit that have been used for model selection and apply them to the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data for comparing two crossing hazard rate functions. We also propose hypothesis testing and graphical methods for model diagnostics of the proposed joint modeling approach. Our proposed methods are illustrated by a simulation study and by a real-data example concerning two early breast cancer treatments.

  {"id":"parrNonparametricFeatureImpact2020","abstract":"Practitioners use feature importance to rank and eliminate weak predictors during model development in an effort to simplify models and improve generality. Unfortunately, they also routinely conflate such feature importance measures with feature impact, the isolated effect of an explanatory variable on the response variable. This can lead to real-world consequences when importance is inappropriately interpreted as impact for business or medical insight purposes. The dominant approach for computing importances is through interrogation of a fitted model, which works well for feature selection, but gives distorted measures of feature impact. The same method applied to the same data set can yield different feature importances, depending on the model, leading us to conclude that impact should be computed directly from the data. While there are nonparametric feature selection algorithms, they typically provide feature rankings, rather than measures of impact or importance. They also typically focus on single-variable associations with the response. In this paper, we give mathematical definitions of feature impact and importance, derived from partial dependence curves, that operate directly on the data. To assess quality, we show that features ranked by these definitions are competitive with existing feature selection techniques using three real data sets for predictive tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Parr","given":"Terence"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"James D."},{"family":"Hamrick","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"parrNonparametricFeatureImpact2020","container-title":"arXiv:2006.04750 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,8]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Nonparametric Feature Impact and Importance","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04750"},
  {"id":"parseghianMechanismsInnateAcquired2019","abstract":"Innate and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy (EGFRi) is a major limitation in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Although RAS genes are the most commonly mutated innate and acquired oncogenes in cancer, there are a number of other mechanisms that limit the effectiveness of EGFRi. Patients with innate resistance have been found to contain BRAFV600E mutations, and possibly MET, MEK, PIK3CA, PTEN, and HER2 alterations. Meanwhile, BRAFV600E mutations may also be involved in acquired resistance to EGFRi, in addition to EGFR ectodomain mutations, MET alterations, and possibly HER2 amplification. In addition, paracrine effects and cell-fate mechanisms of resistance are being increasingly described as contributing to acquired resistance. Utilization of circulating tumor DNA has been paramount in monitoring the dynamic nature of acquired resistance and has helped to guide treatment decisions, particularly in the EGFRi rechallenge setting. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of EGFRi-resistance mechanisms and describe the current therapeutic landscape in the hopes of identifying effective rechallenge strategies.","author":[{"family":"Parseghian","given":"Christine M."},{"family":"Napolitano","given":"Stefania"},{"family":"Loree","given":"Jonathan M."},{"family":"Kopetz","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"parseghianMechanismsInnateAcquired2019","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research: An Official Journal of the American Association for Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin Cancer Res","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0823","ISSN":"1557-3265","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"6899-6908","PMCID":"PMC6891150","PMID":"31263029","source":"PubMed","title":"Mechanisms of Innate and Acquired Resistance to Anti-EGFR Therapy: A Review of Current Knowledge with a Focus on Rechallenge Therapies","title-short":"Mechanisms of Innate and Acquired Resistance to Anti-EGFR Therapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"passeraExplainableMachineLearning2023","abstract":"Artificial intelligence is gaining interest among clinicians, but its results are difficult to be interpreted, especially when dealing with survival outcomes and censored observations. Explainable machine learning (XAI) has been recently extended to this context to improve explainability, interpretability and transparency for modeling results. A cohort of 231 patients undergoing an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was analyzed by XAI for survival by two different uni- and multi-variate survival models, proportional hazard regression and random survival forest, having as the main outcome the overall survival (OS) and its main determinants, using the survex package for R. Both models’ performances were investigated using the integrated Brier score, the integrated Cumulative/Dynamic AUC and the concordance C-index. Global explanation for the whole cohort was performed using the time-dependent variable importance and the partial dependence survival plot. The local explanation for each single patient was obtained via the SurvSHAP(t) and SurvLIME plots and the ceteris paribus survival profile. The survex package common interface ensured a good feasibility of XAI for survival, and the advanced graphical options allowed us to easily explore, explain and compare OS results coming from the two survival models. Before the modeling results to be suitable for clinical use, understandability, clinical relevance and computational efficiency were the most important criteria ensured by this XAI for survival approach, in adherence to clinical XAI guidelines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Passera","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Zompi","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Gill","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Busca","given":"Alessandro"}],"citation-key":"passeraExplainableMachineLearning2023","container-title":"BioMedInformatics","DOI":"10.3390/biomedinformatics3030048","ISSN":"2673-7426","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"752-768","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Explainable Machine Learning (XAI) for Survival in Bone Marrow Transplantation Trials: A Technical Report","title-short":"Explainable Machine Learning (XAI) for Survival in Bone Marrow Transplantation Trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7426/3/3/48","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"paul_2024","abstract":"The increasing importance of uncertainty quantification in the regulatory evaluation of pharmaceutical products has triggered an explosion of Bayesian methods in recent years. In biomarker discovery and early clinical development, Bayesian methods have established a foothold in developing new drugs, in part due to the increasing availability of greater computational power, often complementing both traditional pharmaceutical statistics and classical statistical methods. In this paper, we present a selective survey of the recent efforts that have been made toward the development and application of effective statistical and computational models in early development statistics. The survey introduces four such case studies and methods that can be used for end-to-end biomarker discovery that includes pre-clinical and early clinical development, from unsupervised clustering to supervised machine learning to modern statistical inference, including but not limited to Bayesian clustering, Bayesian additive regression trees, Bayesian neural networks, and empirical Bayes procedures with the overarching goal of promoting their use and applications among pharmaceutical statisticians. Finally, we present some open issues in Bayesian early clinical methods to help guide the future advancement and wide adoption of Bayesian applications in early clinical pharmaceutical statistics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Paul","given":"Erina"},{"family":"Afzal","given":"Avid M."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shanshan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yushi"},{"family":"Matejovicova","given":"Tatiana"},{"family":"Porwal","given":"Anupreet"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhe"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Himel"}],"citation-key":"paul_2024","container-title":"Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications","DOI":"10.1080/23737484.2023.2278112","ISSN":"null","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,2]]},"page":"67–93","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A survey of Bayesian statistical methods in biomarker discovery and early clinical development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/23737484.2023.2278112","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"paulon_2018","abstract":"Heart failure (HF) is one of the main causes of morbidity, hospitalization, and death in the western world, and the economic burden associated with HF management is relevant and expected to increase in the future. We consider hospitalization data for HF in the most populated Italian Region, Lombardia. Data were extracted from the administrative data warehouse of the regional healthcare system. The main clinical outcome of interest is time to death and research focus is on investigating how recurrent hospitalizations affect the time to event. The main contribution of the article is to develop a joint model for gap times between consecutive rehospitalizations and survival time. The probability models for the gap times and for the survival outcome share a common patient specific frailty term. Using a flexible Dirichlet process model for %Bayesian nonparametric prior as the random-effects distribution accounts for patient heterogeneity in recurrent event trajectories. Moreover, the joint model allows for dependent censoring of gap times by death or administrative reasons and for the correlations between different gap times for the same individual. It is straightforward to include covariates in the survival and/or recurrence process through the specification of appropriate regression terms. The main advantages of the proposed methodology are wide applicability, ease of interpretation, and efficient computations. Posterior inference is implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Paulon","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"De Iorio","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Guglielmi","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Ieva","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"paulon_2018","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy026","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/about_us/legal/notices","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Joint modeling of recurrent events and survival: a Bayesian non-parametric approach","title-short":"Joint modeling of recurrent events and survival","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy026/5050476"},
  {"id":"Payet2010","abstract":"We combine random forest (RF) and conditional random field (CRF) into a new computational framework, called random forest random field (RF)2. Inference of (RF)2 uses the Swendsen-Wang cut algorithm, characterized by Metropolis- Hastings jumps. A jump from one state to another depends on the ratio of the proposal distributions, and on the ratio of the posterior distributions of the two states. Prior work typically resorts to a parametric estimation of these four dis- tributions, and then computes their ratio. Our key idea is to instead directly es- timate these ratios using RF. RF collects in leaf nodes of each decision tree the class histograms of training examples. We use these class histograms for a non- parametric estimation of the distribution ratios. We derive the theoretical error bounds of a two-class (RF)2. (RF)2 is applied to a challenging task of multiclass object recognition and segmentation over a random field of input image regions. In our empirical evaluation,we use only the visual information provided by image regions (e.g., color, texture, spatial layout), whereas the competingmethods addi- tionally use higher-level cues about the horizon location and 3D layout of surfaces in the scene. Nevertheless, (RF)2 outperforms the state of the art on benchmark datasets, in terms of accuracy and computation time.","author":[{"family":"Payet","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Todorovic","given":"Sinisa"}],"citation-key":"Payet2010","container-title":"Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 23","editor":[{"family":"Lafferty","given":"J"},{"family":"Williams","given":"C K I"},{"family":"Shawe-Taylor","given":"J"},{"family":"Zemel","given":"R S"},{"family":"Culotta","given":"A"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"1885-1893","title":"(RF)^2 -- Random Forest Random Field","type":"chapter"},

This adds to the survival analysis toolkit by allowing direct prediction of the target variable, along with a distribution-free characterisation of uncertainty, using a flexible function approximator. We begin by showing how an algorithm popular in linear models can be applied to NNs. However, the resulting procedure is inefficient, requiring sequential optimisation of an individual NN at each desired quantile. Our major contribution is a novel algorithm that simultaneously optimises a grid of quantiles output by a single NN. To offer theoretical insight into our algorithm, we show firstly that it can be interpreted as a form of expectation-maximisation, and secondly that it exhibits a desirable `self-correcting' property. Experimentally, the algorithm produces quantiles that are better calibrated than existing methods on 10 out of 12 real datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Jeong","given":"Jong-Hyeon"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yichen"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"pearceCensoredQuantileRegression2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.13496","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,6]]},"number":"arXiv:2205.13496","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Censored Quantile Regression Neural Networks for Distribution-Free Survival Analysis","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13496"},

  {"id":"peng:2021","abstract":"Teaching data analysis by providing students with real-world problems and datasets allows students to integrate a variety of skills in a situation that mirrors how data analysis actually works. However, whole data analyses may obscure the individual skills of data analytic practice that are generalizable across data analyses. One such skill is the ability to diagnose the cause of unexpected results in a data analysis. While experienced analysts can quickly iterate through a series of potential explanations when confronted with unexpected results, novice analysts often struggle to figure out how to move forward. The goal of this article is to describe an approach to teaching students skills in diagnosing data analytic problems.

  {"id":"peng:2021a","abstract":"Teaching data analysis by providing students with real-world problems and datasets allows students to integrate a variety of skills in a situation that mirrors how data analysis actually works. However, whole data analyses may obscure the individual skills of data analytic practice that are generalizable across data analyses. One such skill is the ability to diagnose the cause of unexpected results in a data analysis. While experienced analysts can quickly iterate through a series of potential explanations when confronted with unexpected results, novice analysts often struggle to figure out how to move forward. The goal of this article is to describe an approach to teaching students skills in diagnosing data analytic problems.

  {"id":"pengCirculatingTumorDNA2021","abstract":"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragment in the bloodstream that originates from malignant tumors or circulating tumor cells. Recently, ctDNA has emerged as a promising non-invasive biomarker in clinical oncology. Analysis of ctDNA opens up new avenues for individualized cancer diagnosis and therapy in various types of tumors. Evidence suggests that minimum residual disease (MRD) is closely associated with disease recurrence, thus identifying specific genetic and molecular alterations as novel MRD detection targets using ctDNA has been a research focus. MRD is considered a promising prognostic marker to identify individuals at increased risk of recurrence and who may benefit from treatment. This review summarizes the current knowledge of ctDNA and MRD in solid tumors, focusing on the potential clinical applications and challenges. We describe the current state of ctDNA detection methods and the milestones of ctDNA development and discuss how ctDNA analysis may be an alternative for tissue biopsy. Additionally, we evaluate the clinical utility of ctDNA analysis in solid tumors, such as recurrence risk assessment, monitoring response, and resistance mechanism analysis. MRD detection aids in assessing treatment response, patient prognosis, and risk of recurrence. Moreover, this review highlights current advancements in utilizing ctDNA to monitor the MRD of solid tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Overall, the clinical application of ctDNA-based MRD detection can assist clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes in malignant tumors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Mei","given":"Wuxuan"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Kaidong"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Changchun"}],"citation-key":"pengCirculatingTumorDNA2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"Petersen2006","abstract":"Many common problems in epidemiologic and clinical research involve estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome while blocking the exposure's effect on an intermediate variable. Effects of this kind are termed direct effects. Estimation of direct effects is typically the goal of research aimed at understanding mechanistic pathways by which an exposure acts to cause or prevent disease, as well as in many other settings. Although multivariable regression is commonly used to estimate direct effects, this approach requires assumptions beyond those required for the estimation of total causal effects. In addition, when the exposure and intermediate variables interact to cause disease, multivariable regression estimates a particular type of direct effect-the effect of an exposure on an outcome when the intermediate is fixed at a specified level. Using the counterfactual framework, we distinguish this definition of a direct effect (controlled direct effect) from an alternative definition, in which the effect of the exposure on the intermediate is blocked, but the intermediate is otherwise allowed to vary as it would in the absence of exposure (natural direct effect). We illustrate the difference between controlled and natural direct effects using several examples. We present an estimation approach for natural direct effects that can be implemented using standard statistical software, and we review the assumptions underlying our approach (which are less restrictive than those proposed by previous authors).","author":[{"family":"Petersen","given":"Maya L"},{"family":"Sinisi","given":"Sandra E"},{"family":"Van Der Laan","given":"Mark J"}],"citation-key":"Petersen2006","container-title":"Epidemiology","event-place":"Division of Biostatistics, University of California, School of Public Health, Berkeley, California 94720-7360, USA. mayaliv@berkeley.edu","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"number":"3","page":"276-284","publisher-place":"Division of Biostatistics, University of California, School of Public Health, Berkeley, California 94720-7360, USA. mayaliv@berkeley.edu","title":"Estimation of direct causal effects.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=16617276&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"phungPrognosticModelsBreast2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with a great diversity in outcomes among individual patients. The ability to accurately predict a breast cancer outcome is important to patients, physicians, researchers, and policy makers. Many models have been developed and tested in different settings. We systematically reviewed the prognostic models developed and/or validated for patients with breast cancer.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic search in four electronic databases and some oncology websites, and a manual search in the bibliographies of the included studies. We identified original studies that were published prior to 1st January 2017, and presented the development and/or validation of models based mainly on clinico-pathological factors to predict mortality and/or recurrence in female breast cancer patients.\nRESULTS: From the 96 articles selected from 4095 citations found, we identified 58 models, which predicted mortality (n = 28), recurrence (n = 23), or both (n = 7). The most frequently used predictors were nodal status (n = 49), tumour size (n = 42), tumour grade (n = 29), age at diagnosis (n = 24), and oestrogen receptor status (n = 21). Models were developed in Europe (n = 25), Asia (n = 13), North America (n = 12), and Australia (n = 1) between 1982 and 2016. Models were validated in the development cohorts (n = 43) and/or independent populations (n = 17), by comparing the predicted outcomes with the observed outcomes (n = 55) and/or with the outcomes estimated by other models (n = 32), or the outcomes estimated by individual prognostic factors (n = 8). The most commonly used methods were: Cox proportional hazards regression for model development (n = 32); the absolute differences between the predicted and observed outcomes (n = 30) for calibration; and C-index/AUC (n = 44) for discrimination. Overall, the models performed well in the development cohorts but less accurately in some independent populations, particularly in patients with high risk and young and elderly patients. An exception is the Nottingham Prognostic Index, which retains its predicting ability in most independent populations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many prognostic models have been developed for breast cancer, but only a few have been validated widely in different settings. Importantly, their performance was suboptimal in independent populations, particularly in patients with high risk and in young and elderly patients.","author":[{"family":"Phung","given":"Minh Tung"},{"family":"Tin Tin","given":"Sandar"},{"family":"Elwood","given":"J.

In this paper, we develop an overarching methodology to perform efficient multiple comparisons and modeling for dose finding, under uncertainty about the dose-response shape, using general parametric models. The framework described here is quite broad and can be utilized in situations involving for example generalized nonlinear models, linear and nonlinear mixed effects models, Cox proportional hazards models, with the main restriction being that a univariate dose-response relationship is modeled, that is, both dose and response correspond to univariate measurements. In addition to the core framework, we also develop a general purpose methodology to fit dose-response data in a computationally and statistically efficient way. Several examples illustrate the breadth of applicability of the results.

Such endpoints as heart failure, death due to a specific disease, or control of local disease in cancer may become impossible to observe due to a prior occurrence of a different type of event (such as death from another cause). The event which hinders or changes the possibility of observing the event of interest is called a competing risk. The usual techniques for time-to-event analysis applied in the presence of competing risks give biased or uninterpretable results. The estimation of the probability of the event therefore needs to be calculated using specific techniques such as the cumulative incidence function introduced by Kalbfleisch and Prentice. The model introduced by Fine and Gray can be applied to test a covariate when competing risks are present. Using specific techniques for the analysis of competing risks will ensure that the results are unbiased and can be correctly interpreted.\nResumen\nLa necesidad de desarrollar tratamientos o programas específicos para una enfermedad requiere un análisis de los resultados que sea específico para dicha enfermedad.

  {"id":"piresMulticlassClassificationCalibration2016","abstract":"In this paper we refine the process of computing calibration functions for a number of multiclass classification surrogate losses. Calibration functions are a powerful tool for easily converting bounds for the surrogate risk (which can be computed through well-known methods) into bounds for the true risk, the probability of making a mistake. They are particularly suitable in non-parametric settings, where the approximation error can be controlled, and provide tighter bounds than the common technique of upper-bounding the 0-1 loss by the surrogate loss. The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing calibration function results requires calibration functions to be explicitly derived on a case-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new surrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies the process of deriving calibration functions for a large number of surrogate losses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving calibration functions is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate loss, a small number of conditions that we introduce. As case studies, we recover existing calibration functions for the well-known loss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel calibration functions for well-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic regression loss, plus a number of other losses that have been shown to be classification-calibrated in the past, but for which no calibration function had been derived.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Pires","given":"Bernardo Ávila"},{"family":"Szepesvári","given":"Csaba"}],"citation-key":"piresMulticlassClassificationCalibration2016","container-title":"arXiv:1609.06385 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,20]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Multiclass Classification Calibration Functions","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06385"},
  {"id":"piulachsBayesianJointModel","abstract":"Population aging in most industrialized societies has led to a dramatic increase in emergency medical demand among the elderly. In the context of private health care, an optimal allocation of the medical resources for seniors is commonly done by forecasting their life spans. Accounting for each subject's particularities is therefore indispensable, so the available data must be processed at an individual level. We use a large and unique dataset of insured parties aged 65 and older to appropriately relate the emergency care usage with mortality risk. Longitudinal and time-to-event processes are jointly modeled, and their underlying relationship can therefore be assessed. Such an application, however, requires some special features to also be considered. First, longitudinal demand for emergency services exhibits a nonnegative integer response with an excess of zeros due to the very nature of the data. These subject-specific responses are handled by a zero-inflated version of the hierarchical negative binomial model. Second, event times must account for the left truncation derived from the fact that policyholders must reach the age of 65 before they may begin to be observed. Consequently, a delayed entry bias arises for those individuals entering the study after this age threshold. Third, and as the main challenge of our analysis, the association parameter between both processes is expected to be age-dependent, with an unspecified association structure. This is well-approximated through a flexible functional specification provided by penalized B-splines. The parameter estimation of the joint model is derived under a Bayesian scheme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Piulachs","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Andrinopoulou","given":"Eleni-Rosalina"},{"family":"Guillén","given":"Montserrat"},{"family":"Rizopoulos","given":"Dimitris"}],"citation-key":"piulachsBayesianJointModel","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8767","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A Bayesian joint model for zero-inflated integers and left-truncated event times with a time-varying association: Applications to senior health care","title-short":"A Bayesian joint model for zero-inflated integers and left-truncated event times with a time-varying association","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8767","volume":"n/a"},

A key difference between previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be considered.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Platt","given":"Robert W."},{"family":"Schisterman","given":"Enrique F."},{"family":"Cole","given":"Stephen R."}],"citation-key":"plattTimemodifiedConfounding2009","container-title":"American Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"American Journal of Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1093/aje/kwp175","ISSN":"0002-9262","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,15]]},"page":"687-694","source":"Silverchair","title":"Time-modified Confounding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwp175","volume":"170"},
  {"id":"Pleger2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of heart failure is ever-growing, and it is urgent to develop improved treatments. An attractive approach is gene therapy; however, the clinical barrier has yet to be broken because of several issues, including the lack of an ideal vector supporting safe and long-term myocardial transgene expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that the use of a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV6) vector containing a novel cardiac-selective enhancer/promoter element can direct stable cardiac expression of a therapeutic transgene, the calcium (Ca2+)-sensing S100A1, in a rat model of heart failure. The chronic heart failure-rescuing properties of myocardial S100A1 expression, the result of improved sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling, included improved contractile function and left ventricular remodeling. Adding to the clinical relevance, long-term S100A1 therapy had unique and additive beneficial effects over beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, a current pharmacological heart failure treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that stable increased expression of S100A1 in the failing heart can be used for long-term reversal of LV dysfunction and remodeling. Thus, long-term, cardiac-targeted rAAV6-S100A1 gene therapy may be of potential clinical utility in human heart failure.","author":[{"family":"Pleger","given":"Sven T"},{"family":"Most","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Boucher","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Soltys","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Chuprun","given":"J Kurt"},{"family":"Pleger","given":"Wiebke"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Erhe"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Rengo","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Remppis","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Katus","given":"Hugo A"},{"family":"Eckhart","given":"Andrea D"},{"family":"Rabinowitz","given":"Joseph E"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Walter J"}],"citation-key":"Pleger2007","container-title":"Circulation","DOI":"10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.671701","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"0009-7322 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5]]},"page":"2506-15","PMID":"17470693","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Stable myocardial-specific AAV6-S100A1 gene therapy results in chronic functional heart failure rescue.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.671701","volume":"115"},

  {"id":"pmlr-v152-johansson21a","abstract":"Predictive models communicating algorithmic confidence are very informative, but only if well-calibrated and sharp, i.e., providing accurate probability estimates adjusted for each instance. While almost all machine learning algorithms are able to produce probability estimates, these are often poorly calibrated, thus requiring external calibration. For multiclass problems, external calibration has typically been done using one-vs-all or all-vs-all schemes, thus adding to the computational complexity, but also making it impossible to analyze and inspect the predictive models. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for calibrating inherently multi-class models. Instead of providing a probability distribution over all labels, the estimation is of the probability that the class label predicted by the underlying model is correct. In an extensive empirical study, it is shown that the suggested approach, when applied to both Platt scaling and Venn-Abers, is able to improve the probability estimates from decision trees, random forests and extreme gradient boosting.","author":[{"family":"Johansson","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Löfström","given":"Tuwe"},{"family":"Boström","given":"Henrik"}],"citation-key":"pmlr-v152-johansson21a","collection-title":"Proceedings of machine learning research","container-title":"Proceedings of the tenth symposium on conformal and probabilistic prediction and applications","editor":[{"family":"Carlsson","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"Cherubin","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"An Nguyen","given":"Khuong"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8],["2021",9,10]]},"page":"111–130","publisher":"PMLR","title":"Calibrating multi-class models","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v152/johansson21a.html","volume":"152"},

Patient survival risk-stratification based on DeepProg is significantly better (p-value=7.9e-7 rank sum test) than Similarity Network Fusion based multi-omics data integration in all cancer types. Further comprehensive pan-cancer comparative analysis unveils the genomic signatures common among all the poorest survival subtypes, with genes enriched in extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes. Furthermore, models built on closely related cancer types using DeepProg are predictive of the subtypes of some other cancers, demonstrating the utility of DeepProg for transfer learning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Poirion","given":"Olivier B"},{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Kumardeep"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Sijia"},{"family":"Garmire","given":"Lana X"}],"citation-key":"poirionMultiomicsbasedPancancerPrognosis2019","DOI":"10.1101/19010082","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,25]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Multi-omics-based pan-cancer prognosis prediction using an ensemble of deep-learning and machine-learning models","type":"report","URL":"http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/19010082"},

When working with multiple data sets, a straightforward application of these methods often fails; instead of revealing underlying classes, the resulting visualizations expose data set-specific clusters. To circumvent these batch effects, we propose an embedding procedure that takes a t-SNE visualization constructed on a reference data set and uses it as a scaffold for embedding new data. The new, secondary data is embedded one data-point at the time. This prevents any interactions between instances in the secondary data and implicitly mitigates batch effects. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with an analysis of six recently published single-cell gene expression data sets containing up to tens of thousands of cells and thousands of genes. In these data sets, the batch effects are particularly strong as the data comes from different institutions and was obtained using different experimental protocols. The visualizations constructed by our proposed approach are cleared of batch effects, and the cells from secondary data sets correctly co-cluster with cells from the primary data sharing the same cell type.","author":[{"family":"Poličar","given":"Pavlin G."},{"family":"Stražar","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Strazar","given":"M."},{"family":"Zupan","given":"Blaž"},{"family":"Zupan","given":"Blaz"}],"citation-key":"policarEmbeddingReferenceTSNE2019","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/671404","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,14]]},"note":"MAG ID: 2952832549","page":"671404","title":"Embedding to Reference t-SNE Space Addresses Batch Effects in Single-Cell Classification","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"polleyPowerEstimationBiomarker2017","abstract":"BackgroundThe clinical utility of a new biomarker should ideally be established in a prospective randomized clinical trial. However, such trials are not always practical. As such, it is common for investigators to identify promising biomarkers using archived specimens and clinical data collected from previously completed therapeutic trials. Simon et al. defined such biomarker studies as prospective?retrospective studies and proposed specific conditions to satisfy for such evaluations to be more than hypothesis generating. One condition they proposed is that archived tissues must be available on a sufficiently large number of patients from the pivotal trials to ensure adequately powered analyses.PurposeThe purpose of this article is to provide a new perspective on how to estimate power for assessing the prognostic and predictive values of a single binary biomarker in prospective?retrospective biomarker studies. Computer programs are provided to facilitate the use of these methods in practice.MethodsThe proposed methods utilize additional information that becomes available during the course of the treatment trial including sample size, accrual time, additional follow-up time, and the observed number of events at time of biomarker analysis. These methods involve solving for the exponential hazard rates that give rise to the event numbers that are consistent with those observed while satisfying other design parameter constraints.ConclusionSimon et al. proposed a new paradigm for biomarker design, conduct, analysis, and evaluation in prospective?retrospective studies that offers a more efficient alternative than fully prospective biomarker studies. As a general rule, they suggest that samples from at least two-thirds of the patients be available for analysis. In this article, I expand on this issue and provide a methodological tool useful for estimating study power in prospective?retrospective biomarker studies. It is my hope that these incremental efforts to improve the quality and statistical rigor in biomarker studies will hasten the introduction of useful tumor biomarkers into clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Polley","given":"Mei-Yin C"}],"citation-key":"polleyPowerEstimationBiomarker2017","container-title":"Clinical Trials","container-title-short":"Clinical Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774517723830","ISSN":"1740-7745","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"621-628","publisher":"SAGE Publications","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Power estimation in biomarker studies where events are already observed","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1740774517723830","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"polleyStatisticalConsiderationsEvaluation2021","abstract":"Discovery of biomarkers has been steadily increasing over the past decade. Although a plethora of biomarkers has been reported in the biomedical literature, few have been sufficiently validated for broader clinical applications. One particular challenge that may have hindered the adoption of biomarkers into practice is the lack of reproducible biomarker cut points. In this article, we attempt to identify some common statistical issues related to biomarker cut point identification and provide guidance on proper evaluation, interpretation, and validation of such cut points. First, we illustrate how discretization of a continuous biomarker using sample percentiles results in significant information loss and should be avoided. Second, we review the popular “minimal-P-value” approach for cut point identification and show that this method results in highly unstable P values and unduly increases the chance of significant findings when the biomarker is not associated with outcome. Third, we critically review a common analysis strategy by which the selected biomarker cut point is used to categorize patients into different risk categories and then the difference in survival curves among these risk groups in the same dataset is claimed as the evidence supporting the biomarker’s prognostic strength. We show that this method yields an exaggerated P value and overestimates the prognostic impact of the biomarker. We illustrate that the degree of the optimistic bias increases with the number of variables being considered in a risk model. Finally, we discuss methods to appropriately ascertain the additional prognostic contribution of the new biomarker in disease settings where standard prognostic factors already exist. Throughout the article, we use real examples in oncology to highlight relevant methodologic issues, and when appropriate, we use simulations to illustrate more abstract statistical concepts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Polley","given":"Mei-Yin C."},{"family":"Dignam","given":"James J."}],"citation-key":"polleyStatisticalConsiderationsEvaluation2021","container-title":"Journal of Nuclear Medicine","container-title-short":"J Nucl Med","DOI":"10.2967/jnumed.120.251520","ISSN":"0161-5505","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,10]]},"page":"605-611","PMCID":"PMC8844257","PMID":"33579807","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Statistical Considerations in the Evaluation of Continuous Biomarkers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8844257/","volume":"62"},

However, data are limited regarding these physicians' views of cancer survivors' care.To compare PCPs and oncologists with regard to their knowledge, attitudes, and practices for follow-up care of breast and colon cancer survivors.Mailed questionnaires were completed by a nationally representative sample of 1,072 PCPs and 1,130 medical oncologists in 2009 (cooperation rate = 65%). Sampling and non-response weights were used to calculate estimates to reflect practicing US PCPs and oncologists.PCPs and oncologists reported their 1) preferred model for delivering cancer survivors' care; 2) assessment of PCPs' ability to perform follow-up care tasks; 3) confidence in their knowledge; and 4) cancer surveillance practices.Compared with PCPs, oncologists were less likely to believe PCPs had the skills to conduct appropriate testing for breast cancer recurrence (59% vs. 23%, P < 0.001) or to care for late effects of breast cancer (75% vs. 38%, P < 0.001). Only 40% of PCPs were very confident of their own knowledge of testing for recurrence. PCPs were more likely than oncologists to endorse routine use of non-recommended blood and imaging tests for detecting cancer recurrence, with both groups departing substantially from guideline recommendations.There are significant differences in PCPs' and oncologists' knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to care of cancer survivors. Improving cancer survivors' care may require more effective communication between these two groups to increase PCPs' confidence in their knowledge, and must also address oncologists' attitudes regarding PCPs' ability to care for cancer survivors.","author":[{"family":"Potosky","given":"Arnold L"},{"family":"Han","given":"Paul K J"},{"family":"Rowland","given":"Julia"},{"family":"Klabunde","given":"Carrie N"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Tenbroeck"},{"family":"Aziz","given":"Noreen"},{"family":"Earle","given":"Craig"},{"family":"Ayanian","given":"John Z"},{"family":"Ganz","given":"Patricia A"},{"family":"Stefanek","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"Potosky2011","container-title":"Journal of General Internal Medicine","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"number":"12","page":"1403-1410","title":"Differences between primary care physicians' and oncologists' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the care of cancer survivors.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11606-011-1808-4","volume":"26"},

Pragmatic tools building off clinical tumor next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms could have the potential to increase assay accessibility.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We evaluated the widely available Foundation Medicine comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) platform as a source of variants for tracking of ctDNA when analyzing residual samples from IMvigor010 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02450331), a randomized adjuvant study comparing atezolizumab with observation after bladder cancer surgery. Current methods often involve germline sampling, which is not always feasible or practical. Rather than performing white blood cell sequencing to filter germline and clonal hematopoiesis (CH) variants, we applied a bioinformatic approach to select tumor (non-germline/CH) variants for molecular residual disease detection.

  {"id":"probstHyperparametersTuningStrategies2019","abstract":"The random forest (RF) algorithm has several hyperparameters that have to be set by the user, for example, the number of observations drawn randomly for each tree and whether they are drawn with or without replacement, the number of variables drawn randomly for each split, the splitting rule, the minimum number of samples that a node must contain, and the number of trees. In this paper, we first provide a literature review on the parameters' influence on the prediction performance and on variable importance measures. It is well known that in most cases RF works reasonably well with the default values of the hyperparameters specified in software packages. Nevertheless, tuning the hyperparameters can improve the performance of RF. In the second part of this paper, after a presenting brief overview of tuning strategies, we demonstrate the application of one of the most established tuning strategies, model-based optimization (MBO). To make it easier to use, we provide the tuneRanger R package that tunes RF with MBO automatically. In a benchmark study on several datasets, we compare the prediction performance and runtime of tuneRanger with other tuning implementations in R and RF with default hyperparameters.

Methods: We have analysed a sample of 1850 probable AD patients from the UK and Greece with 10 item NeuropsychiatricInventory(NPI) data. We applied a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) approach to investigate the effect of MMSE, disease duration, gender, age and age of onset on the structure of a four-factor model consisting of “psychosis”, “moods”, “agitation” and “behavioural dyscontrol”. Results: Specific clinical variables predicted the expression of individual factors. When the inter-relationship of factors is modelled, some previously significant associations are lost. For example, lower MMSE scores predict psychosis, agitation and behavioural dyscontrol factors, but psychosis and mood predict the agitation factor. Taking these associations into account MMSE scores did not predict agitation. Conclusions: The complexity of the inter-relations between symptoms, factors and clinical variables is efficiently captured by this MIMIC model.","author":[{"family":"Proitsi","given":"P"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"G"},{"family":"Tsolaki","given":"M"},{"family":"Lupton","given":"M"},{"family":"Daniilidou","given":"M"},{"family":"Hollingworth","given":"P"},{"family":"Archer","given":"N"},{"family":"Foy","given":"C"},{"family":"Stylios","given":"F"},{"family":"McGuinness","given":"B"},{"family":"Todd","given":"S"},{"family":"Lawlor","given":"B"},{"family":"Gill","given":"M"},{"family":"Brayne","given":"C"},{"family":"Rubinsztein","given":"D C"},{"family":"Owen","given":"M"},{"family":"Williams","given":"J"},{"family":"Craig","given":"D"},{"family":"Passmore","given":"P"},{"family":"Lovestone","given":"S"},{"family":"Powell","given":"J F"}],"citation-key":"proitsiMultipleIndicatorsMultiple2011","container-title":"Neurobiology of Aging","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"number":"3","page":"434-442","title":"A Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model of Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD)","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0197458009001018","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"prosperiCausalInferenceCounterfactual2020","abstract":"Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine—from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Prosperi","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Sperrin","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Koopman","given":"James S."},{"family":"Min","given":"Jae S."},{"family":"He","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Rich","given":"Shannan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Mo"},{"family":"Buchan","given":"Iain E."},{"family":"Bian","given":"Jiang"}],"citation-key":"prosperiCausalInferenceCounterfactual2020","container-title":"Nature Machine Intelligence","container-title-short":"Nat Mach Intell","DOI":"10.1038/s42256-020-0197-y","ISSN":"2522-5839","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 Springer Nature Limited","number":"7","page":"369-375","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Causal inference and counterfactual prediction in machine learning for actionable healthcare","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0197-y","volume":"2"},

Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to define Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespecified threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efficient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Psioda","given":"Matthew A"},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Joseph G"}],"citation-key":"psioda_2019","container-title":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxy009","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"400-415","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian clinical trial design using historical data that inform the treatment effect","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/20/3/400/4935054","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"pullinComparisonMarkerGene2022","abstract":"Abstract\n          \n            The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled scientists to catalogue and probe the transcriptional heterogeneity of individual cells in unprecedented detail. A common step in the analysis of scRNA-seq data is the selection of so-called marker genes, most commonly to enable annotation of the biological cell types present in the sample. In this paper we benchmarked 56 computational methods for selecting marker genes in scRNA-seq data. The performance of the methods was compared using 10 real scRNA-seq datasets and over 170 additional simulated datasets. Methods were compared on their ability to recover simulated and expert-annotated marker genes, the predictive performance and characteristics of the gene sets they select, their memory usage and speed and their implementation quality. In addition, various case studies were used to scrutinise the most commonly used methods, highlighting issues and inconsistencies.

  {"id":"putter:2007","abstract":"Standard survival data measure the time span from some time origin until the occurrence of one type of event. If several types of events occur, a model describing progression to each of these competing risks is needed. Multi-state models generalize competing risks models by also describing transitions to intermediate events. Methods to analyze such models have been developed over the last two decades. Fortunately, most of the analyzes can be performed within the standard statistical packages, but may require some extra effort with respect to data preparation and programming. This tutorial aims to review statistical methods for the analysis of competing risks and multi-state models. Although some conceptual issues are covered, the emphasis is on practical issues like data preparation, estimation of the effect of covariates, and estimation of cumulative incidence functions and state and transition probabilities. Examples of analysis with standard software are shown.

  {"id":"putterRelationCauseSpecific2020","abstract":"The Fine–Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model has been puzzling many people since its introduction. The main reason for the uneasy feeling is that the approach considers individuals still at risk for an event of cause 1 after they fell victim to the competing risk of cause 2. The subdistribution hazard and the extended risk sets, where subjects who failed of the competing risk remain in the risk set, are generally perceived as unnatural . One could say it is somewhat of a riddle why the Fine–Gray approach yields valid inference. To take away these uneasy feelings, we explore the link between the Fine–Gray and cause‐specific approaches in more detail. We introduce the reduction factor as representing the proportion of subjects in the Fine–Gray risk set that has not yet experienced a competing event. In the presence of covariates, the dependence of the reduction factor on a covariate gives information on how the effect of the covariate on the cause‐specific hazard and the subdistribution hazard relate. We discuss estimation and modeling of the reduction factor, and show how they can be used in various ways to estimate cumulative incidences, given the covariates.

  {"id":"putzelDynamicSurvivalAnalysis","abstract":"Dynamic survival analysis is a variant of traditional survival analysis where time-to-event predictions are updated as new information arrives about an individual over time. In this paper we propose a new approach to dynamic survival analysis based on learning a global parametric distribution, followed by individualization via truncating and renormalizing that distribution at diﬀerent locations over time. We combine this approach with a likelihoodbased loss that includes predictions at every time step within an individual’s history, rather than just including one term per individual. The combination of this loss and model results in an interpretable approach to dynamic survival, requiring less ﬁne tuning than existing methods, while still achieving good predictive performance. We evaluate the approach on the problem of predicting hospital mortality for a dataset with over 6900 COVID-19 patients.","author":[{"family":"Putzel","given":"Preston"},{"family":"Smyth","given":"Padhraic"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jaehong"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Hua"}],"citation-key":"putzelDynamicSurvivalAnalysis","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Dynamic Survival Analysis with Individualized Truncated Parametric Distributions","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"qiuComparisonStudyMachine2020","abstract":"BackgroundMachine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly explored in glioma prognostication. Random survival forest (RSF) is a common ML approach in analyzing time-to-event survival data. However, it is controversial which method between RSF and traditional cornerstone method Cox proportional hazards (CPH) is better fitted. The purpose of this study was to compare RSF and CPH in predicting tumor progression of high-grade glioma (HGG) after particle beam radiotherapy (PBRT).MethodsThe study enrolled 82 consecutive HGG patients who were treated with PBRT at Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center between 6/2015 and 11/2019. The entire cohort was split into the training and testing set in an 80/20 ratio. Ten variables from patient-related, tumor-related and treatment-related information were utilized for developing CPH and RSF for predicting progression-free survival (PFS). The model performance was compared in concordance index (C-index) for discrimination (accuracy), brier score (BS) for calibration (precision) and variable importance for interpretability.ResultsThe CPH model demonstrated a better performance in terms of integrated C-index (62.9%) and BS (0.159) compared to RSF model (C-index = 61.1%, BS = 0.174). In the context of variable importance, CPH model indicated that age (P = 0.024), WHO grade (P = 0.020), IDH gene (P = 0.019), and MGMT promoter status (P = 0.040) were significantly correlated with PFS in the univariate analysis; multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.041), surgical completeness (P = 0.084), IDH gene (P = 0.057), and MGMT promoter (P = 0.092) had a significant or trend toward the relation with PFS. RSF showed that merely IDH and age were of positive importance for predicting PFS. A final nomogram was developed to predict tumor progression at the individual level based on CPH model.ConclusionsIn a relatively small dataset with HGG patients treated with PBRT, CPH outperformed RSF for predicting tumor progression. A comprehensive criterion with accuracy, precision, and interpretability is recommended in evaluating ML prognostication approaches for clinical deployment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"Xianxin"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jiyi"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Weixu"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jiade J."}],"citation-key":"qiuComparisonStudyMachine2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"A Comparison Study of Machine Learning (Random Survival Forest) and Classic Statistic (Cox Proportional Hazards) for Predicting Progression in High-Grade Glioma after Proton and Carbon Ion Radiotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2020.551420","volume":"10"},

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Three methods of partitioning attributable risks are reviewed and two additional procedures as modifications of the existing algorithms are introduced. Basis properties of the approaches are outlined in the simplest setting with two exposure variables. The extension to more complex settings is illustrated by an example involving three risk factors. RESULTS: The quantification of the impact of single-risk factors can vary considerably according to the method used. Different orderings of the risk factors with respect to their impact can occur. Approaches can be classified according to two features: (i) inclusion or exclusion of partial interactions between risk factors, (ii) equal or proportional distribution of the surplus resulting from the combined action of risk factors. Practical applications have to carefully consider intrinsic limitations of all partitioning approaches. CONCLUSION: The decision on which concept to use when partitioning attributable risks on the population level should be based on the desired properties the solution ought to have. Arguments from game-theoretical reasoning can help to guide further research in this area, especially in exploring the methods using proportional division rules that are not yet fully understood.","author":[{"family":"Rabe","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Lehnert-Batar","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Gefeller","given":"Olaf"}],"citation-key":"Rabe2007","container-title":"Journal of clinical epidemiology","event-place":"Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Waldstrasse 6, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. christina.rabe@imbe.imed.uni-erlangen.de","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"number":"5","page":"461-468","publisher-place":"Department of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Waldstrasse 6, 91054 Erlangen, Germany. christina.rabe@imbe.imed.uni-erlangen.de","title":"Generalized approaches to partitioning the attributable risk of interacting risk factors can remedy existing pitfalls","type":"article-journal","URL":"papers2://publication/doi/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2006.06.024","volume":"60"},

  {"id":"radke:2003","abstract":"Interval-censoring occurs in survival analysis when the time until an event of interest is not known precisely (and instead, only is known to fall into a particular interval). Such censoring commonly is produced when periodic assessments (usually clinical or laboratory examinations) are used to assess if the event has occurred. My objectives were to raise awareness about interval-censoring including its existence, the potential ramifications of ignoring its existence, the different types of interval-censored data, and the analytical methods to analyze such data (including availability in standard statistical software). Asynchronous interval-censored survival analysis was demonstrated by parametric evaluation of risk factors for the time to first detected shedding of Salmonella muenster (identified by repeated periodic fecal cultures) for a herd of dairy cows. These results were compared with those from survival analyses which ignored or approximated the interval-censoring. Ignoring or approximating the asynchronous interval-censoring in the survival analysis generally resulted in the risk factors' regression coefficients having the same signs and a decrease (often >50%) in their absolute size. All the standard errors from the three methods of approximating the interval-censoring were <40% of their interval-censored counterparts. The conclusions drawn from the asynchronous interval-censored analysis versus those from the approximations varied dramatically. (The general conclusion from the approximations was that none of the risk factors for this example warranted further consideration.) That ignoring or approximating the left- and interval-censored nature of the dependent variable resulted in biased results was consistent with the literature. In the currently available asynchronous interval-censored models, the inclusion of time-dependent covariates that vary continuously is awkward. Statistical models for the semi-parametric estimation of asynchronous interval-censored survival analysis are not generally available in standard statistical software.","author":[{"family":"Radke","given":"Brian R."}],"citation-key":"radke:2003","container-title":"Preventive Veterinary Medicine","container-title-short":"Prev Vet Med","DOI":"10.1016/s0167-5877(03)00103-x","ISSN":"0167-5877","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"241-256","PMID":"12835007","source":"PubMed","title":"A demonstration of interval-censored survival analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"59"},
  {"id":"Rafetseder2013","abstract":"The objective of this study was to describe the developmental progression of counterfactual reasoning from childhood to adulthood. In contrast to the traditional view, it was recently reported by Rafetseder and colleagues that even a majority of 6-year-old children do not engage in counterfactual reasoning when asked counterfactual questions (Child Development, 2010, Vol. 81, pp. 376-389). By continuing to use the same method, the main result of the current Study 1 was that performance of the 9- to 11-year-olds was comparable to that of the 6-year-olds, whereas the 12- to 14-year-olds approximated adult performance. Study 2, using an intuitively simpler task based on Harris and colleagues (Cognition, 1996, Vol. 61, pp. 233-259), resulted in a similar conclusion, specifically that the ability to apply counterfactual reasoning is not fully developed in all children before 12 years of age. We conclude that children who failed our tasks seem to lack an understanding of what needs to be changed (events that are causally dependent on the counterfactual assumption) and what needs to be left unchanged and so needs to be kept as it actually happened.

Many of the statistical approaches developed for CRA are limited by strong assumptions about the underlying stochastic processes. To overcome these issues and to handle censoring, machine learning approaches for CRA have designed specialized cost functions. However, these approaches are not generalizable, and are computationally expensive. This paper formulates CRA as a cause-specific regression problem and proposes DeepPseudo models, which use simple and effective feed-forward deep neural networks, to predict the cumulative incidence function (CIF) using Aalen-Johansen estimator-based pseudo values. DeepPseudo models capture the time-varying covariate effect on CIF while handling the censored observations. We show how DeepPseudo models can address co-variate dependent censoring by using modified pseudo values. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our proposed models obtain promising and statistically significant results compared to the state-of-the-art CRA approaches. Furthermore, we show that explainable methods such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation can be used to interpret the predictions of our DeepPseudo models.","author":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Md Mahmudur"},{"family":"Matsuo","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Matsuzaki","given":"Shinya"},{"family":"Purushotham","given":"Sanjay"}],"citation-key":"Rahman_Matsuo_Matsuzaki_Purushotham_2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"page":"479-487","title":"DeepPseudo: Pseudo value based deep learning models for competing risk analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/16125","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"rahmanDeviationProportionalHazards2019","abstract":"Purpose: Deviations from proportional hazards (DPHs), which may be more prevalent in the era of precision medicine and immunotherapy, can lead to underpowered trials or misleading conclusions. We used a meta-analytic approach to estimate DPHs across cancer trials, investigate associated factors, and evaluate data-analysis approaches for future trials.Experimental Design: We searched PubMed for phase III trials in breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer published in a preselected list of journals between 2014 and 2016 and extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) from Kaplan–Meier curves. We re-analyzed IPLD to identify DPHs. Potential efficiency gains, when DPHs were present, of alternative statistical methods relative to standard log-rank based analysis were expressed as sample-size requirements for a fixed power level.\nResults: From 152 trials, we obtained IPLD on 129,401 patients. Among 304 Kaplan–Meier figures, 75 (24.7%) exhibited evidence of DPHs, including eight of 14 (57%) KM pairs from immunotherapy trials. Trial type [immunotherapy, odds ratio (OR), 4.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11–16.6], metastatic patient population (OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 1.26–8.05), and non-OS endpoints (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.79–5.88) were associated with DPHs. In immunotherapy trials, alternative statistical approaches allowed for more efficient clinical trials with fewer patients (up to 74% reduction) relative to log-rank testing.\nConclusions: DPHs were found in a notable proportion of time-to-event outcomes in published clinical trials in oncology and was more common for immunotherapy trials and non-OS endpoints. Alternative statistical methods, without proportional hazards assumptions, should be considered in the design and analysis of clinical trials when the likelihood of DPHs is high.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Rifaquat"},{"family":"Fell","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Ventz","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Arfé","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Vanderbeek","given":"Alyssa M."},{"family":"Trippa","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Brian M."}],"citation-key":"rahmanDeviationProportionalHazards2019","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clin Cancer Res","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3999","ISSN":"1078-0432, 1557-3265","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","page":"6339-6345","PMID":"31345838","publisher":"American Association for Cancer Research","section":"Precision Medicine and Imaging","source":"clincancerres.aacrjournals.org","title":"Deviation from the Proportional Hazards Assumption in Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trials in Oncology: Prevalence, Associated Factors, and Implications","title-short":"Deviation from the Proportional Hazards Assumption in Randomized Phase 3 Clinical Trials in Oncology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/25/21/6339","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"ramachandramurthy_2019","abstract":"Item response theory (IRT), which originated from psychometric theory, relates to latent variable models for psychological assessment . IRT's contributions have been less extensively studied in cancer research even though IRT has become prevalent in the measurement of ability and item parameters with respect to latent traits. Benefits of IRT include comprehensive analyses and reduction of measurement error, meaningful scaling of latent variables, evaluation of test and item bias, greater accuracy in the assessment of change due to therapeutic intervention, and evaluation of model and person fit. Advances in cancer biology and human genetics have resulted in the identification of driver events and critical biologic dependencies. These advances, together with the development of drugs for specific biologic targets hold promise for an era of personalized oncology treatment. Therefore, robust discovery of biomarkers associated with the biologic mechanisms that drive cancers could provide clinicians with the ability to tailor therapeutic strategies for individual patients, thus improving clinical outcomes. Incorporating biomarkers in clinical trials during drug development may also allow for determining the optimal patient population for a given drug, thus maximizing its efficacy. Thus, this chapter explores the application of different IRT models in the discovery of biomarkers and altered biologic processes in cancer. The utility and limitations of the IRT models in the discovery of biomarkers or biological mechanisms are highlighted through simulations and application to genome-scale molecular profiling studies of cancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ramachandra Murthy","given":"Katabathula"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Salendra"},{"family":"Tuck","given":"David"},{"family":"Varadan","given":"Vinay"}],"citation-key":"ramachandramurthy_2019","collection-title":"Integrated Population Biology and Modeling, Part B","container-title":"Handbook of Statistics","DOI":"10.1016/bs.host.2018.09.005","editor":[{"family":"Srinivasa Rao","given":"Arni S.

  {"id":"rauMachineLearningModels2019","abstract":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to build a model using machine learning for the prediction of survival in trauma patients and compared these model predictions to those predicted by the most commonly used algorithm, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS).\nMETHODS: Enrolled hospitalized trauma patients from 2009 to 2016 were divided into a training dataset (70% of the original data set) for generation of a plausible model under supervised classification, and a test dataset (30% of the original data set) to test the performance of the model. The training and test datasets comprised 13,208 (12,871 survival and 337 mortality) and 5603 (5473 survival and 130 mortality) patients, respectively. With the provision of additional information such as pre-existing comorbidity status or laboratory data, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) (with the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (RSNNS)) were used to build models of survival prediction and compared to the predictive performance of TRISS. Predictive performance was evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as by area under the curve (AUC) measures of receiver operating characteristic curves.\nRESULTS: In the validation dataset, NN and the TRISS presented the highest score (82.0%) for balanced accuracy, followed by SVM (75.2%) and LR (71.8%) models. In the test dataset, NN had the highest balanced accuracy (75.1%), followed by the TRISS (70.2%), SVM (70.6%), and LR (68.9%) models. All four models (LR, SVM, NN, and TRISS) exhibited a high accuracy of more than 97.5% and a sensitivity of more than 98.6%. However, NN exhibited the highest specificity (51.5%), followed by the TRISS (41.5%), SVM (40.8%), and LR (38.5%) models.\nCONCLUSIONS: These four models (LR, SVM, NN, and TRISS) exhibited a similar high accuracy and sensitivity in predicting the survival of the trauma patients. In the test dataset, the NN model had the highest balanced accuracy and predictive specificity.","author":[{"family":"Rau","given":"Cheng-Shyuan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shao-Chun"},{"family":"Chuang","given":"Jung-Fang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chun-Ying"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hang-Tsung"},{"family":"Chien","given":"Peng-Chen"},{"family":"Hsieh","given":"Ching-Hua"}],"citation-key":"rauMachineLearningModels2019","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","container-title-short":"J Clin Med","DOI":"10.3390/jcm8060799","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,5]]},"language":"eng","PMCID":"PMC6616432","PMID":"31195670","source":"PubMed","title":"Machine Learning Models of Survival Prediction in Trauma Patients","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"rennert_2022","abstract":"Truncation is a statistical phenomenon that occurs in many time to event studies. For example, autopsy-confirmed studies of neurodegenerative diseases are subject to an inherent left and right truncation, also known as double truncation. When the goal is to study the effect of risk factors on survival, the standard Cox regression model cannot be used when the survival time is subject to truncation. Existing methods which adjust for both left and right truncation in the Cox regression model require independence between the survival times and truncation times, which may not be a reasonable assumption in practice. We propose an expectation-maximization algorithm to relax the independence assumption in the Cox regression model under left, right, or double truncation to an assumption of conditional independence on the observed covariates. The resulting regression coefficient estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed estimator has little bias and has a similar or lower mean-squared error compared to existing estimators. We implement our approach to assess the effect of occupation on survival in subjects with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer’s disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Rennert","given":"Lior"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Sharon X."}],"citation-key":"rennert_2022","container-title":"Biometrics","container-title-short":"Biometrics","DOI":"10.1111/biom.13451","ISSN":"0006-341X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"page":"460-473","PMCID":"PMC8426413","PMID":"33687064","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cox Regression Model under Dependent Truncation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8426413/","volume":"78"},

However, existing machine learning approaches to diagnosis are purely associative, identifying diseases that are strongly correlated with a patients symptoms. We show that this inability to disentangle correlation from causation can result in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To overcome this, we reformulate diagnosis as a counterfactual inference task and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms. We compare our counterfactual algorithms to the standard associative algorithm and 44 doctors using a test set of clinical vignettes. While the associative algorithm achieves an accuracy placing in the top 48% of doctors in our cohort, our counterfactual algorithm places in the top 25% of doctors, achieving expert clinical accuracy.

To address this concern, a conservative approach to Bayesian trial design is illustrated here, requiring that the operational characteristics of the primary trial outcome are stronger than the prior. This approach is complementary to current Bayesian design methods, in that it insures against prior‐data conflict by defining a sample size commensurate to a discrete design prior. This approach is ethical, in that it requires designs appropriate to achieving pre‐specified levels of clinical equipoise imbalance. Practical examples are discussed, illustrating design of trials with binary or time to event endpoints. Moderate increases in phase II study sample size are shown to deliver strong levels of overall evidence for go/no‐go clinical development decisions. Levels of negative evidence provided by group sequential confirmatory designs are found negligible, highlighting the importance of complementing efficacy boundaries with non‐binding futility criteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Rigat","given":"Fabio"}],"citation-key":"rigat:2024","container-title":"Pharmaceutical Statistics","container-title-short":"Pharmaceutical Statistics","DOI":"10.1002/pst.2339","ISSN":"1539-1604, 1539-1612","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1]]},"language":"en","page":"81-90","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A conservative approach to leveraging external evidence for effective clinical trial design","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pst.2339","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"riley:2019","abstract":"When designing a study to develop a new prediction model with binary or time-to-event outcomes, researchers should ensure their sample size is adequate in terms of the number of participants (n) and outcome events (E) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) considered for inclusion. We propose that the minimum values of n and E (and subsequently the minimum number of events per predictor parameter, EPP) should be calculated to meet the following three criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9, (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R2, and (iii) precise estimation of the overall risk in the population. Criteria (i) and (ii) aim to reduce overfitting conditional on a chosen p, and require prespecification of the model's anticipated Cox-Snell R2, which we show can be obtained from previous studies. The values of n and E that meet all three criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. Upon application of our approach, a new diagnostic model for Chagas disease requires an EPP of at least 4.8 and a new prognostic model for recurrent venous thromboembolism requires an EPP of at least 23. This reinforces why rules of thumb (eg, 10 EPP) should be avoided. Researchers might additionally ensure the sample size gives precise estimates of key predictor effects; this is especially important when key categorical predictors have few events in some categories, as this may substantially increase the numbers required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Riley","given":"Richard D"},{"family":"Snell","given":"Kym IE"},{"family":"Ensor","given":"Joie"},{"family":"Burke","given":"Danielle L"},{"family":"Harrell Jr","given":"Frank E"},{"family":"Moons","given":"Karel GM"},{"family":"Collins","given":"Gary S"}],"citation-key":"riley:2019","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.7992","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 The Authors.

  {"id":"riley:2019a","abstract":"In the medical literature, hundreds of prediction models are being developed to predict health outcomes in individuals. For continuous outcomes, typically a linear regression model is developed to predict an individual's outcome value conditional on values of multiple predictors (covariates). To improve model development and reduce the potential for overfitting, a suitable sample size is required in terms of the number of subjects (n) relative to the number of predictor parameters (p) for potential inclusion. We propose that the minimum value of n should meet the following four key criteria: (i) small optimism in predictor effect estimates as defined by a global shrinkage factor of ≥0.9; (ii) small absolute difference of ≤ 0.05 in the apparent and adjusted R2; (iii) precise estimation (a margin of error ≤ 10% of the true value) of the model's residual standard deviation; and similarly, (iv) precise estimation of the mean predicted outcome value (model intercept). The criteria require prespecification of the user's chosen p and the model's anticipated R2 as informed by previous studies. The value of n that meets all four criteria provides the minimum sample size required for model development. In an applied example, a new model to predict lung function in African-American women using 25 predictor parameters requires at least 918 subjects to meet all criteria, corresponding to at least 36.7 subjects per predictor parameter. Even larger sample sizes may be needed to additionally ensure precise estimates of key predictor effects, especially when important categorical predictors have low prevalence in certain categories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Riley","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Snell","given":"Kym I.E."},{"family":"Ensor","given":"Joie"},{"family":"Burke","given":"Danielle L."},{"family":"Harrell Jr","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Moons","given":"Karel G.M."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Gary S."}],"citation-key":"riley:2019a","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/sim.7993","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","page":"1262-1275","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Minimum sample size for developing a multivariable prediction model: Part I – Continuous outcomes","title-short":"Minimum sample size for developing a multivariable prediction model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.7993","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"riley:2021","abstract":"Objectives: When developing a clinical prediction model, penalization techniques are recommended to address overﬁtting, as they shrink predictor effect estimates toward the null and reduce mean-square prediction error in new individuals. However, shrinkage and penalty terms (‘tuning parameters’) are estimated with uncertainty from the development data set. We examined the magnitude of this uncertainty and the subsequent impact on prediction model performance. Study Design and Setting: This study comprises applied examples and a simulation study of the following methods: uniform shrinkage (estimated via a closed-form solution or bootstrapping), ridge regression, the lasso, and elastic net.\nResults: In a particular model development data set, penalization methods can be unreliable because tuning parameters are estimated with large uncertainty. This is of most concern when development data sets have a small effective sample size and the model’s Cox-Snell R2 is low. The problem can lead to considerable miscalibration of model predictions in new individuals.\nConclusion: Penalization methods are not a ‘carte blanche’; they do not guarantee a reliable prediction model is developed. They are more unreliable when needed most (i.e., when overﬁtting may be large). We recommend they are best applied with large effective sample sizes, as identiﬁed from recent sample size calculations that aim to minimize the potential for model overﬁtting and precisely estimate key parameters.

  {"id":"rileyStabilityClinicalPrediction","abstract":"Clinical prediction models estimate an individual's risk of a particular health outcome. A developed model is a consequence of the development dataset and model-building strategy, including the sample size, number of predictors, and analysis method (e.g., regression or machine learning). We raise the concern that many models are developed using small datasets that lead to instability in the model and its predictions (estimated risks). We define four levels of model stability in estimated risks moving from the overall mean to the individual level. Through simulation and case studies of statistical and machine learning approaches, we show instability in a model's estimated risks is often considerable, and ultimately manifests itself as miscalibration of predictions in new data. Therefore, we recommend researchers always examine instability at the model development stage and propose instability plots and measures to do so. This entails repeating the model-building steps (those used to develop the original prediction model) in each of multiple (e.g., 1000) bootstrap samples, to produce multiple bootstrap models, and deriving (i) a prediction instability plot of bootstrap model versus original model predictions; (ii) the mean absolute prediction error (mean absolute difference between individuals’ original and bootstrap model predictions), and (iii) calibration, classification, and decision curve instability plots of bootstrap models applied in the original sample. A case study illustrates how these instability assessments help reassure (or not) whether model predictions are likely to be reliable (or not), while informing a model's critical appraisal (risk of bias rating), fairness, and further validation requirements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Riley","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Gary S."}],"citation-key":"rileyStabilityClinicalPrediction","container-title":"Biometrical Journal","DOI":"10.1002/bimj.202200302","ISSN":"1521-4036","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.

Additionally, we discuss the choice of a suitable parameterization, from a practitioner's point of view, to relate the longitudinal process to the survival outcome.

Seven patients underwent immediate RC, whereas 41 elected bladder preservation with close surveillance. Of those remaining 41 patients, mean age was 68 ± 11 years with median follow-up of 35 months. NAC regimens were 46% methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin, 39% gemcitabine/cisplatin, and 15% other platinum-based therapies. Five-year cancer-specific survival was 87%, disease-free survival was 58%, and cystectomy-free survival was 79%.

We then developed a patient-level simulation model to project number of patients referred for LTx and 5-year survival, accounting for transplant availability, organ allocation policy, and heterogenous treatment effects.\nResults: Only 12% of patients (95% conﬁdence interval 11%-13%) were referred for LTx over 5 years under UC, compared with 19% (18%-20%) under FEV1 and 20% (19%-22%) under ML. Of 309 patients who died before LTx referral under UC, 31% (27%36%) would have been referred under FEV1 and 40% (35%-45%) would have been referred under ML. Given a ﬁxed supply of organs, differences in referral time did not lead to signiﬁcant differences in transplants, pretransplant or post-transplant deaths, or overall survival in 5 years.\nConclusions: Health outcomes modeling with RWD may help to identify novel ML risk prediction models with high potential real-world clinical utility and rule out further investment in models that are unlikely to offer meaningful real-world beneﬁts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodriguez","given":"Patricia J."},{"family":"Veenstra","given":"David L."},{"family":"Heagerty","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Goss","given":"Christopher H."},{"family":"Ramos","given":"Kathleen J."},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Aasthaa"}],"citation-key":"rodriguez:2022","container-title":"Value in Health","container-title-short":"Value in Health","DOI":"10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.1360","ISSN":"10983015","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","page":"350-358","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Framework for Using Real-World Data and Health Outcomes Modeling to Evaluate Machine Learning–Based Risk Prediction Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1098301521031910","volume":"25"},

An estimation of the potential impact of CTS prevention programs in the workplace would be useful for public policy. The aim of this study was to assess the work-related population-attributable fraction (PAF) of CTS in industrial sectors and occupational categories at high risk of CTS in the general population. METHODS: All cases of CTS occurring in patients living in a French region were included prospectively between 2002-2004. Using a mailed questionnaire, we gathered medical and occupational history from 815 women and 320 men. We calculated the age-adjusted relative risks and PAF of CTS in relation to industrial sectors and occupational categories. RESULTS: The PAF for women was higher in lower-grade, white-collar workers (24%, 95% CI 19-29) than blue-collar workers (19%, 95% CI 15-22). The PAF was higher for the service industries sector (16%, 95% CI 8-22) than manufacturing (10%, 95% CI 7-13) or agricultural (5%, 95% CI 3-7) sectors. The PAF was high for men in blue-collar workers (50%, 95% CI 41-57) and in the construction (13%, 95% CI 9-18) and manufacturing industries (17%, 95% CI 10-23). CONCLUSION: The study suggested that 5-50% of CTS cases might be avoided in the whole population if totally effective intervention programs were implemented in specific occupational categories or industrial sectors.","author":[{"family":"Roquelaure","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Fouquet","given":"Natacha"},{"family":"Descatha","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Leclerc","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Marcel"},{"family":"Imbernon","given":"Ellen"}],"citation-key":"Roquelaure2009","container-title":"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health","event-place":"Laboratoire d'Ergonomie et d'Epidémiologie en Santé au Travail, Université d'Angers (LEEST-UA InVS-EA) [Laboratory of Ergonomics and Epidemiology in Health at Work, University of Angers], Angers, France.

While machine learning advances have permeated many disciplines, inference for these procedures, and in particular, causal inference, has not been widespread. However, this is rapidly changing. As different scientific fields begin to converge on machine learning for causal inference, we thought now would be an excellent time to have a public discussion. In our roles as editors of Biostatistics, we decided to organize a series of commentaries on the topic from scholars with expertise in statistics, computer science, epidemiology, health economics, policy, and law. We intentionally invited leaders who are early or mid-career scholars and considered multiple dimensions of intersectional diversity to increase the range of voices given a platform. Machine learning specifically for causal inference is a smaller area, thus this involved reading conference programs, arXiv papers, and department websites along with sending invitations in waves in an attempt to achieve a balance of perspectives. Not everyone said yes, which is not unexpected given we were deliberately reaching outside our professional networks and across disciplines. We share these experiences for the potential benefit of other organizers and to argue that this time investment is necessary.

However, currently available diagnostic tools still suffer from significant operator-dependent variability. To fill this gap, physicians have shown a constantly increasing interest towards new resources able to enhance diagnostic performances. In this regard, several reports have highlighted how artificial intelligence (AI) can produce promising results in the BCa field. In this narrative review, we aimed to analyze the most recent literature exploring current experiences and future perspectives on the role of AI in the BCa scenario. We summarized the most recently investigated applications of AI in BCa management, focusing on how this technology could impact physicians’ accuracy in three widespread diagnostic areas: cystoscopy, clinical tumor (cT) staging, and pathological diagnosis. Our results showed the wide potential of AI in BCa, although larger prospective and well-designed trials are pending to draw definitive conclusions allowing AI to be routinely applied to everyday clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Rossin","given":"Giulio"},{"family":"Zorzi","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Ongaro","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Piasentin","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Vedovo","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Liguori","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Zucchi","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Simonato","given":"Alchiede"},{"family":"Bartoletti","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Trombetta","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Pavan","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Claps","given":"Francesco"}],"citation-key":"rossin_2023","container-title":"BioMedInformatics","DOI":"10.3390/biomedinformatics3010008","ISSN":"2673-7426","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"1","page":"104-114","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Artificial Intelligence in Bladder Cancer Diagnosis: Current Applications and Future Perspectives","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence in Bladder Cancer Diagnosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-7426/3/1/8","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"roy_2017","abstract":"Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a general class of causal models for specifying the average effect of treatment on an outcome. These models can accommodate discrete or continuous treatments, as well as treatment effect heterogeneity (causal effect modification). The literature on estimation of MSM parameters has been dominated by semiparametric estimation methods, such as inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW). Likelihood-based methods have received little development, probably in part due to the need to integrate out confounders from the likelihood and due to reluctance to make parametric modeling assumptions. In this article we develop a fully Bayesian MSM for continuous and survival outcomes. In particular, we take a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) approach, using a combination of a dependent Dirichlet process and Gaussian process to model the observed data. The BNP approach, like semiparametric methods such as IPTW, does not require specifying a parametric outcome distribution. Moreover, by using a likelihood-based method, there are potential gains in efficiency over semiparametric methods. An additional advantage of taking a fully Bayesian approach is the ability to account for uncertainty in our (uncheckable) identifying assumption. To this end, we propose informative prior distributions that can be used to capture uncertainty about the identifying \"no unmeasured confounders\" assumption. Thus, posterior inference about the causal effect parameters can reflect the degree of uncertainty about this assumption. The performance of the methodology is evaluated in several simulation studies. The results show substantial efficiency gains over semiparametric methods, and very little efficiency loss over correctly specified maximum likelihood estimates. The method is also applied to data from a study on neurocognitive performance in HIV-infected women and a study of the comparative effectiveness of antihypertensive drug classes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Roy","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Lum","given":"Kirsten J."},{"family":"Daniels","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"roy_2017","container-title":"Biostatistics","container-title-short":"Biostat","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxw029","ISSN":"1465-4644, 1468-4357","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1]]},"language":"en","page":"32-47","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"A Bayesian nonparametric approach to marginal structural models for point treatments and a continuous or survival outcome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw029","volume":"18"},

This provides new alternatives to the positivity condition for inverse probability weighting. The probability distribution that would govern the frequency of observations in the counterfactual scenario can be characterized in terms of a so-called martingale problem. The counterfactual and factual probability distributions may be related through a likelihood ratio given by a stochastic differential equation. We can perform inference for counterfactual scenarios based on the original observations, re-weighted according to this likelihood ratio. This is possible if the solution of the stochastic differential equation is uniformly integrable, a property that can be determined by comparing the corresponding factual and counterfactual short-term predictions. Local independence graphs are directed, possibly cyclic, graphs that represent short-term prediction among sufficiently autonomous stochastic processes. We show through an example that these graphs can be used to identify and provide consistent estimators for counterfactual parameters in continuous time.

Attempts to represent curvature in single- or multiple-regression models are usually made by means of polynomials of the covariates, typically quadratics. However, low order polynomials offer a limited family of shapes, and high order polynomials may fit poorly at the extreme values of the covariates. We propose an extended family of curves, which we call fractional polynomials, whose power terms are restricted to a small predefined set of integer and non-integer values. The powers are selected so that conventional polynomials are a subset of the family. Regression models using fractional polynomials of the covariates have appeared in the literature in an ad hoc fashion over a long period; we provide a unified description and a degree of formalization for them. They are shown to have considerable flexibility and are straightforward to fit using standard methods. We suggest an iterative algorithm for covariate selection and model fitting when several covariates are available. We give six examples of the use of fractional polynomial models in three types of regression analysis: normal errors, logistic and Cox regression.

In addition, a prospective singlecenter study in hematuria patient group (Cohort 3, n = 174) was used as a second validation of the model.\nResults:  The assay with a dual-marker detection model showed 88.1% and 91.2% sensitivities, 89.7% and 85.7% spe‑cificities in validation Cohort 2 (patients of suspected BC) and Cohort 3 (patients of hematuria), respectively. Further‑more, this assay showed improved sensitivities over cytology and FISH on detecting low-grade tumor (66.7–77.8% vs. 0.0–22.2%, 0.0–22.2%), Ta tumor (83.3% vs. 22.2–41.2%, 44.4–52.9%) and non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) (80.0–89.7% vs. 51.5–52.0%, 59.4–72.0%) in both cohorts.

  {"id":"ruberg_2023a","abstract":"The pharmaceutical industry and its global regulators have routinely used frequentist statistical methods, such as null hypothesis significance testing and p values, for evaluation and approval of new treatments. The clinical drug development process, however, with its accumulation of data over time, can be well suited for the use of Bayesian statistical approaches that explicitly incorporate existing data into clinical trial design, analysis and decision-making. Such approaches, if used appropriately, have the potential to substantially reduce the time and cost of bringing innovative medicines to patients, as well as to reduce the exposure of patients in clinical trials to ineffective or unsafe treatment regimens. Nevertheless, despite advances in Bayesian methodology, the availability of the necessary computational power and growing amounts of relevant existing data that could be used, Bayesian methods remain underused in the clinical development and regulatory review of new therapies. Here, we highlight the value of Bayesian methods in drug development, discuss barriers to their application and recommend approaches to address them.

  {"id":"rubergDetentePracticalUnderstanding2021","abstract":"Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) with its benchmark P value < 0.05 has long been a stalwart of scientific reporting and such statistically significant findings have been used to imply scientifically or clinically significant findings. Challenges to this approach have arisen over the past 6 decades, but they have largely been unheeded. There is a growing movement for using Bayesian statistical inference to quantify the probability that a scientific finding is credible. There have been differences of opinion between the frequentist (i.e., NHST) and Bayesian schools of inference, and warnings about the use or misuse of P values have come from both schools of thought spanning many decades. Controversies in this arena have been heightened by the American Statistical Association statement on P values and the further denouncement of the term “statistical significance” by others. My experience has been that many scientists, including many statisticians, do not have a sound conceptual grasp of the fundamental differences in these approaches, thereby creating even greater confusion and acrimony. If we let A represent the observed data, and B represent the hypothesis of interest, then the fundamental distinction between these two approaches can be described as the frequentist approach using the conditional probability pr(A | B) (i.e., the P value), and the Bayesian approach using pr(B | A) (the posterior probability). This paper will further explain the fundamental differences in NHST and Bayesian approaches and demonstrate how they can co-exist harmoniously to guide clinical trial design and inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruberg","given":"Stephen J."}],"citation-key":"rubergDetentePracticalUnderstanding2021","container-title":"Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics","DOI":"10.1002/cpt.2004","ISSN":"1532-6535","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"1489-1498","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Détente: A Practical Understanding of P values and Bayesian Posterior Probabilities","title-short":"Détente","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpt.2004","volume":"109"},
  {"id":"rubergPersonalizedMedicineFour2015","abstract":"With the rapid advancement of scientific understanding in the medical field, everyday use of personalized medicine appears within our grasp. Unfortunately, there are still challenges to overcome. In many therapeutic areas, there remains a lack of deep understanding of disease processes and treatments. Additionally, drug development proceeds over a 5–10 year timeframe, during which time knowledge of treatments and potential predictive biomarkers continues to evolve. For successful development of a drug that is tailored to a biomarker-defined patient population and approved by regulators for such use, employment of appropriate statistical design and analysis methods is paramount. Consequently, statisticians can play a leading role in transforming the practice of medicine to a more personalized approach. We describe four perspectives in clinical development, together with examples of each, and discuss how to approach the problem of demonstrating that a treatment works better in a biomarker-defined subgroup of patients than in its complementary subgroup. The four perspectives provide a framework for design of clinical trials and subsequent analyses as they relate to clinical development. Subgroup identification is described as a controlled, disciplined search for finding the right patient for treatment and is distinguished from traditional, exploratory subgroup analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruberg","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Shen","given":"Lei"}],"citation-key":"rubergPersonalizedMedicineFour2015","container-title":"Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research","container-title-short":"null","DOI":"10.1080/19466315.2015.1059354","ISSN":"null","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7,3]]},"page":"214-229","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"amstat.tandfonline.com (Atypon)","title":"Personalized Medicine: Four Perspectives of Tailored Medicine","title-short":"Personalized Medicine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19466315.2015.1059354","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"rubergResolvingCredibilityCrisis2023","abstract":"The promise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for improving clinical outcomes has been marked by modest successes, but also many failures. Access to data and to advanced algorithms makes developing AI/ML tools relatively easy—but the real challenge is demonstrating their clinical utility. Clinical predictive algorithms (CPAs)—algorithms for diagnosis or prognosis—are failing to meet their potential for two key reasons. First, when developers assess the quality of CPAs, they tend to rely too heavily on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), ignoring the prevalence of the characteristic of interest, which is critical to understanding the positive and negative predictive value of the CPA. We propose a more holistic approach to optimizing the development of a CPA, as has been taken with bioanalytical diagnostic tests and physiologic biomarkers for decades. Second, insufficient emphasis has been placed on performing rigorous clinical trials to quantify the benefits and risks of implementing a CPA. We propose a fit-for-purpose, sequential clinical development approach analogous to development of new medicinal products, biomarkers, and other complex interventions, in some cases overseen by regulatory agencies. With these two recommendations met, the benefits and risks of a CPA will be clearer, resulting in greater credibility, transparency, and utility.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruberg","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Menon","given":"Sandeep"},{"family":"Demanuele","given":"Charmaine"}],"citation-key":"rubergResolvingCredibilityCrisis2023","container-title":"Harvard Data Science Review","DOI":"10.1162/99608f92.c1292c54","ISSN":", 2644-2353","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,27]]},"language":"en","source":"hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu","title":"Resolving the Credibility Crisis: Recommendations for Improving Predictive Algorithms for Clinical Utility","title-short":"Resolving the Credibility Crisis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/fx7g21em/release/1","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"russell:2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            The non-invasive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma has been shown to have clinical value for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), emergence of resistance, and predicting treatment response. The sensitive detection of MRD following curative treatment allows for the identification of patients destined to recur. Higher assay sensitivities enable the longest lead times to clinical recurrence. Evaluations using several contrived pan-cancer samples have shown that the Inivata RaDaR tumor-informed personalized assay has a high sensitivity to detect ctDNA. The tumor-informed analysis utilizes sequencing of the tumor tissue to identify up to 48 clonal somatic variants, which are selected to generate a personalized panel to track the variants in patient plasma. To evaluate this technology in a disease specific manner, we generated a set of contrived plasma samples from commercial breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. The biological materials allowed us to generate a plasma sample with defined range of tumor content between 0.2 and 0.001% variant allele fraction (VAF). The sample dilutions were intended to recapitulate challenging cell-free DNA inputs that can be encountered in a clinical setting (median input: 5.76 ng [range 0.22 to 103.73]. Through our pan-cancer and breast cancer evaluations, we were able generate both sensitivity metrics along with a small limit of detection (LOD) study. The assay successfully detected tumor fractions in samples tested at 1X and 1.5X of the established LOD95% of 0.0011% VAF. RaDaR was able to detect the majority of MRD+ samples at 0.5X LOD. We will present data showing the level of sensitivity based on using both 2000 and 20000 genomic equivalents. The RaDaR assay showed high sensitivity for pan-cancer as well as ER+ breast cancer, which is known to have a low TMB compared to other subtypes. In this albeit small LoD study the Inivata assay was highly sensitive for the detection of ctDNA which is imperative to confidently detect ctDNA in advance of overt clinical recurrence.\n            Citation Format: Hugh Russell, Paul LaBrousse, Daniel Stetson, Greg Jones, Giovanni Marsico, Tim Forshew, Robert McEwen, Elza De Bruin, Christopher Abbosh, Darren Hodgson, Brian Dougherty, James Hadfield, Carl Barrett.

  {"id":"Sabel2012","abstract":"INTRODUCTION:To identify melanoma patients at sufficiently low risk of nodal metastases who could avoid sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), several statistical models have been proposed based upon patient/tumor characteristics, including logistic regression, classification trees, random forests, and support vector machines. We sought to validate recently published models meant to predict sentinel node status.\n\nMETHODS:We queried our comprehensive, prospectively collected melanoma database for consecutive melanoma patients undergoing SLNB. Prediction values were estimated based upon four published models, calculating the same reported metrics: negative predictive value (NPV), rate of negative predictions (RNP), and false-negative rate (FNR).\n\nRESULTS:Logistic regression performed comparably with our data when considering NPV (89.4 versus 93.6%); however, the model's specificity was not high enough to significantly reduce the rate of biopsies (SLN reduction rate of 2.9%). When applied to our data, the classification tree produced NPV and reduction in biopsy rates that were lower (87.7 versus 94.1 and 29.8 versus 14.3, respectively). Two published models could not be applied to our data due to model complexity and the use of proprietary software.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:Published models meant to reduce the SLNB rate among patients with melanoma either underperformed when applied to our larger dataset, or could not be validated. Differences in selection criteria and histopathologic interpretation likely resulted in underperformance. Statistical predictive models must be developed in a clinically applicable manner to allow for both validation and ultimately clinical utility.","author":[{"family":"Sabel","given":"Michael S"},{"family":"Rice","given":"John D"},{"family":"Griffith","given":"Kent A"},{"family":"Lowe","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Sandra L"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Alfred E"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Timothy M"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Jeremy M G"}],"citation-key":"Sabel2012","container-title":"Annals of surgical oncology","event-place":"Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Health System, 3304 Cancer Center, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-0932, USA. msabel@umich.edu","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"number":"1","page":"287-293","publisher-place":"Department of Surgery, University of Michigan Health System, 3304 Cancer Center, 1500 East Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109-0932, USA. msabel@umich.edu","title":"Validation of statistical predictive models meant to select melanoma patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=21822550&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"19"},

Cross-validation is the standard approach for evaluating the accuracy of such algorithms; however, several cross-validations methods exist and only some of them are statistically meaningful. Here we compared two popular cross-validation methods: record-wise and subject-wise. Using both a publicly available dataset and a simulation, we found that record-wise cross-validation often massively overestimates the prediction accuracy of the algorithms. We also found that this erroneous method is used by almost half of the retrieved studies that used accelerometers, wearable sensors, or smartphones to predict clinical outcomes.

The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) computing a graphical representation of a data set (fuzzy simplicial complex) and (2) through stochastic gradient descent, optimizing a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we extend the second step of UMAP to a parametric optimization over neural network weights, learning a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We first demonstrate that parametric UMAP performs comparably to its nonparametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g., fast online embeddings for new data). We then explore UMAP as a regularization, constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, parametrically varying global structure preservation, and improving classifier accuracy for semisupervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.","author":[{"family":"Sainburg","given":"Tim"},{"literal":"Leland McInnes"},{"family":"McInnes","given":"Leland"},{"family":"Gentner","given":"Timothy Q."}],"citation-key":"sainburgParametricUMAPEmbeddings2021","container-title":"Neural Computation","DOI":"10.1162/neco_a_01434","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,30]]},"note":"MAG ID: 3197209004","page":"2881-2907","PMID":"34474477","title":"Parametric UMAP Embeddings for Representation and Semisupervised Learning.","type":"article-journal","volume":"33"},

Eighteen eligible treatment networks were identified for different diseases, involving 4 to 16 alternative treatments and 10 to 84 trials. Networks in which 1 option (placebo or no treatment) was the typical comparator were star-shaped, even though several treatments might have had proven effectiveness. Other networks had different shapes. Some showed important co-occurrence that avoided specific head-to-head comparisons. Comparison choices sometimes seemed justified, such as when newer treatments were not compared with older ones already shown to be inferior, whereas other choices seemed to reflect preference bias.\n\nLIMITATIONS:Networks evolve over time as new trials accumulate, and their geometry may change. Statistical testing for co-occurrence is underpowered when few trials exist.\n\nCONCLUSION:Evaluation of the geometry of a treatment network can offer valuable insights for the interpretation of total evidence when many treatment options are available.","author":[{"family":"Salanti","given":"Georgia"},{"family":"Kavvoura","given":"Fotini K"},{"family":"Ioannidis","given":"John P A"}],"citation-key":"Salanti2008a","container-title":"Annals of Internal Medicine","event-place":"University of Ioannina School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece.","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"number":"7","page":"544-553","publisher-place":"University of Ioannina School of Medicine, Ioannina, Greece.","title":"Exploring the geometry of treatment networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=18378949&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"148"},

Throughout this paper, we use Alzheimer’s disease to create examples for illustrating how CML can be advantageous in clinical scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges present in healthcare applications such as processing high-dimensional and unstructured data, generalization to out-of-distribution samples and temporal relationships, that despite the great effort from the research community remain to be solved.

Serum prostate-specific antigen which has a modest value as a screening biomarker while widely used in practice in all subsequent stages has limitations for prognostication or prediction of drug efficacy. Recent advances in genomic sciences and the identification of the mutational landscape of organ-confined and advanced-stage disease have contributed to the development of molecular biomarker profiling in addition to serum prostate-specific antigen. Genomic biomarkers are in development for application to screening for lethal disease subtypes, monitoring of disease recurrence after initial treatments, prognostication, as well as for prediction of drug efficacy. The application of translational molecular profiling in prostate cancer has the potential to enhance clinical management and outcomes in the future. Molecular biomarkers in development in organ-confined disease include both DNA- and RNA-based candidate and pathway-based biomarkers. In advanced-stage disease, molecular biomarker profiling has emerged for identifying therapeutic targets, prediction of drug efficacy, and for prognostication of survival that includes germline single nucleotide profiling and somatic aberrations including copy number variation and mutations and RNA-based profiling.

We measured three time perspectives (future, present fatalistic, and present hedonistic) with the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory and medication adherence by self-report. RESULTS: The total model demonstrated a good fit (RMSEA=0.17, 90% CI [0.10, 0.28], p=0.003; comparative fit index=0.91). Future time perspective and age showed direct effects on increased medication adherence; an increase by a single unit in future time perspective was associated with a 0.32 standard deviation increase in reported adherence. There were no significant indirect effects of time perspective with reported medication adherence through health beliefs. CONCLUSION: The findings provide the first evidence that time perspective plays an under-recognized role as a psychological motivator in medication adherence.

Transplantation, for example, is a competing event for death on the waiting list because receiving a transplant may significantly decrease the risk of long-term mortality. In a typical analysis of time-to-event data, competing events may be censored or incorporated into composite end points; however, the presence of competing events violates the assumption of “independent censoring,” which is the basis of standard survival analysis techniques. The use of composite end points disregards the possibility that competing events may be related to the exposure in a way that is different from the other components of the composite. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, this paper reviews the principles of competing risks analysis; outlines approaches for analyzing data with competing events (cause-specific and subdistribution hazards models); compares the estimates obtained from standard survival analysis, which handle competing events as censoring events; discusses the appropriate settings in which each of the two approaches could be used; and contrasts their interpretation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sapir-Pichhadze","given":"R."},{"family":"Pintilie","given":"M."},{"family":"Tinckam","given":"K.

  {"id":"satagopanNoteCompetingRisks2004","abstract":"Survival analysis encompasses investigation of time to event data. In most clinical studies, estimating the cumulative incidence function (or the probability of experiencing an event by a given time) is of primary interest. When the data consist of patients who experience an event and censored individuals, a nonparametric estimate of the cumulative incidence can be obtained using the Kaplan–Meier method. Under this approach, the censoring mechanism is assumed to be noninformative. In other words, the survival time of an individual (or the time at which a subject experiences an event) is assumed to be independent of a mechanism that would cause the patient to be censored. Often times, a patient may experience an event other than the one of interest which alters the probability of experiencing the event of interest. Such events are known as competing risk events. In this setting, it would often be of interest to calculate the cumulative incidence of a specific event of interest. Any subject who does not experience the event of interest can be treated as censored. However, a patient experiencing a competing risk event is censored in an informative manner. Hence, the Kaplan–Meier estimation procedure may not be directly applicable. The cumulative incidence function for an event of interest must be calculated by appropriately accounting for the presence of competing risk events. In this paper, we illustrate nonparametric estimation of the cumulative incidence function for an event of interest in the presence of competing risk events using two published data sets. We compare the resulting estimates with those obtained using the Kaplan–Meier approach to demonstrate the importance of appropriately estimating the cumulative incidence of an event of interest in the presence of competing risk events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Satagopan","given":"J.

We model the longitudinal and survival outcomes using linear mixed-effects and Weibull frailty models, respectively. Because of the limit of detection, missing covariate (explanatory variable, x) values may lead to the non-ignorable missing, resulting in biased parameter estimates with poor coverage probabilities of the confidence interval. We define and estimate the probability of missing due to the limit of detection. Then we develop a novel joint density and hence the likelihood function that incorporates the effect of left-censored covariate.

Tumor tissue biopsy, especially in genitourinary (GU) system is sometimes inadequate and requires invasive surgical options, especially for upper tract urothelial cancer. Urine can prove to be “liquid gold” since it may be a more abundant source of tumor-derived material without the background noise; however, urine DNA (uDNA) may be associated with low mutant allele fraction (MAF). Molecular detection of mutations in uDNA requires a sensitive and accurate method of analysis that allows a high depth of sequencing while minimizing artifacts. Several sequencing approaches to address this hurdle using enhanced library preparation techniques such as Tagged amplicon deep sequencing (TAm-Seq), Safe-SeqS, FAST-SeqS, and CAPP-Seq approaches have been developed. Urine biopsy utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) can prove useful at all stages of urologic malignancy care, where urine can be collected to aid in clinical decision making through the identiﬁcation of commonly known mutations, and potentially reduce or avoid all forms of invasive procedures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Satyal","given":"Uttam"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Abbosh","given":"Philip H."}],"citation-key":"satyal_2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front.

We examined the test agreement between HC2 and PCR detection for any of 13 carcinogenic human papillomavirus types targeted by HC2 and compared clinical performance of the 2 tests for detecting concurrent and follow-up cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 or cancer. The k value for the 2 assays was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.66), with 82.7% crude agreement. HC2 was more sensitive (93.6% vs 89.3%; P ¡ .0005) but less specific (41.2% vs 48.5%; P ¡ .0005) than PCR for detecting 2-year cumulative CIN 3 or cancer (n = 503). The presence of multiple types as detected by PCR and/or cytologic abnormality increased the likelihood of an HC2+ result. Increased sensitivity of HC2 compared with PCR was surprising, given the theoretical advantages of PCR-based methods for analytic sensitivity. Smaller amounts of material used in PCR could have limited its sensitivity, but our results demonstrate the importance of optimization and standardization of PCR-based assays for clinical applications.","author":[{"family":"Schiffman","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Wheeler","given":"Cosette M"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Diane"},{"family":"Castle","given":"Philip E"}],"citation-key":"Schiffman2005","container-title":"American Journal Of Clinical Pathology","DOI":"10.1309/E067-X0L1-U3CY-37NW","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"0002-9173 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11]]},"page":"722-32","PMID":"16203281","publisher-place":"United States","title":"A comparison of a prototype PCR assay and hybrid capture 2 for detection of carcinogenic human papillomavirus DNA in women with equivocal or mildly abnormal papanicolaou smears.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1309/E067-X0L1-U3CY-37NW","volume":"124"},

  {"id":"schmidDiscretetimeSurvivalForests2020","abstract":"Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful nonparametric method for building prediction models with a time-to-event outcome. RSF do not rely on the proportional hazards assumption and can be readily applied to both low- and higher-dimensional data. A remaining limitation of RSF, however, arises from the fact that the method is almost entirely focussed on continuously measured event times. This issue may become problematic in studies where time is measured on a discrete scale $$t = 1, 2, ...$$, referring to time intervals $$[0,a_1), [a_1,a_2), \\ldots $$. In this situation, the application of methods designed for continuous time-to-event data may lead to biased estimators and inaccurate predictions if discreteness is ignored. To address this issue, we develop a RSF algorithm that is specifically designed for the analysis of (possibly right-censored) discrete event times. The algorithm is based on an ensemble of discrete-time survival trees that operate on transformed versions of the original time-to-event data using tree methods for binary classification. As the outcome variable in these trees is typically highly imbalanced, our algorithm implements a node splitting strategy based on Hellinger’s distance, which is a skew-insensitive alternative to classical split criteria such as the Gini impurity. The new algorithm thus provides flexible nonparametric predictions of individual-specific discrete hazard and survival functions. Our numerical results suggest that node splitting by Hellinger’s distance improves predictive performance when compared to the Gini impurity. Furthermore, discrete-time RSF improve prediction accuracy when compared to RSF approaches treating discrete event times as continuous in situations where the number of time intervals is small.","author":[{"family":"Schmid","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Welchowski","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Marvin N."},{"family":"Berger","given":"Moritz"}],"citation-key":"schmidDiscretetimeSurvivalForests2020","container-title":"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery","container-title-short":"Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery","DOI":"10.1007/s10618-020-00682-z","ISSN":"1573-756X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",5,1]]},"page":"812-832","title":"Discrete-time survival forests with Hellinger distance decision trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-020-00682-z","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"schmidUseHarrellClinical2016","abstract":"Random survival forests (RSF) are a powerful method for risk prediction of right-censored outcomes in biomedical research. RSF use the log-rank split criterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to evaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index for survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the split criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest. This discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting and evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria analytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more unbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that the log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In simulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate that the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be improved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node splitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or the fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely, log-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank splitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as split criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank split criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmid","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Marvin"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"schmidUseHarrellClinical2016","container-title":"arXiv:1507.03092 [stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",7,18]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"On the use of Harrell's C for clinical risk prediction via random survival forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03092"},

  {"id":"schollWhenBiomarkerAD2021","abstract":"Abstract Background Tremendous recent developments have expanded the portfolio of biomarkers that have been described as directly specific for Alzheimer?s disease (AD) pathophysiology or assessing its consequences. This presentation will aim to provide a snapshot of the current validation and readiness status of imaging- and bodily fluid-based AD biomarkers for different potential application scenarios. Method An overview of AD biomarker characteristics will be provided, focusing on established and emerging positron emission tomography (PET) and blood-based biomarkers for amyloid-? (A?) and tau pathology as well as glial activation and synaptic and neurodegeneration. Summarizing and discussing the foregoing talks in this session as well as reviewing relevant literature, emphasis will be placed on unique validation and application aspects of the respective biomarkers and on practical considerations. Result AD-related pathophysiology and its consequences can be assessed in vivo directly in the brain or in bodily fluids, most recently also in blood. The underlying modalities differ greatly in how their proposed face validity is confirmed, i.e. how specific the respective biomarker is to disease-specific processes and how sensitive to longitudinal changes and different disease stages. Specifically, PET enables the direct mapping, quantification, and staging of regional pathology and related processes in the brain, while blood-based measures generally provide information about peripheral, yet highly associated processes. Both yield continuous measures; however, this information is often discarded in favor of dichotomous, and global, biomarker classification. Novel blood-based biomarkers have thus been claimed to have diagnostic and prognostic properties comparable with PET modalities. PET is limited to specialized centers, is resource-hungry and involves radiation, while blood-based biomarkers promise a scalable and accessible alternative or complement. However, the construct validity of blood biomarkers has hitherto mainly been established against relevant PET biomarkers. Finally, the various levels of harmonization and standardization of biomarker acquisition and analysis have major implications for their potential application. Conclusion The field of AD biomarkers is more dynamic than ever. Snapshot evaluations of their current state of validity, their potential use and their practical limitations are needed to establish their potential differential, joint, and complementary roles in AD diagnostics, population screening, clinical trial enrichment, and use as trial outcome measure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Schöll","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"schollWhenBiomarkerAD2021","container-title":"Alzheimer's & Dementia","DOI":"10.1002/alz.055681","ISSN":"1552-5260","issue":"S5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"e055681","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"When is a biomarker an AD biomarker?

In such settings, privacy concerns typically prohibit sharing of individual patient data, and instead, cross-network analyses can only utilize summary statistics from the individual databases such as hazard ratios and standard errors. In the specific but very common context of the Cox proportional hazards model, we show that combining such per site summary statistics into a single network-wide estimate using standard meta-analysis methods leads to substantial bias when outcome counts are small. This bias derives primarily from the normal approximations of the per site likelihood that the methods utilized. Here we propose and evaluate methods that eschew normal approximations in favor of three more flexible approximations: a skew-normal, a one-dimensional grid, and a custom parametric function that mimics the behavior of the Cox likelihood function. In extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate how these approximations impact bias in the context of both fixed-effects and (Bayesian) random-effects models. We then apply these approaches to three real-world studies of the comparative safety of antidepressants, each using data from four observational health care databases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Schuemie","given":"Martijn J."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Madigan","given":"David"},{"family":"Suchard","given":"Marc A."}],"citation-key":"schuemieCombiningCoxRegressions2022","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/09622802211060518","ISSN":"0962-2802","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"438-450","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Combining cox regressions across a heterogeneous distributed research network facing small and zero counts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802211060518","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"Schwartz2008","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The value of frozen sections in the intraoperative examination of sentinel nodes (SN) remains controversial. Accurate frozen sections will spare those patients with node metastasis from a second procedure to complete the axillary dissection. We examined our own experience with intraoperative examination of SN. STUDY DESIGN: Between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006, we performed 236 sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures that were read as \"frozen-section-negative.\" An additional 47 sentinel lymph node biopsy patients were frozen-section-positive for metastatic disease and underwent immediate completion axillary dissection. At least 1 SN was found in all 283 women (100%). The number of patients with false-negative frozen sections was tallied; patient data were reviewed for a number of variables to see which factors might be associated with a false-negative result. RESULTS: Eleven patients had positive nodes on subsequent examination of the formalin-fixed, hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides; the false-negative rate of intraoperative frozen section was 4.7%. The sensitivity of the negative frozen section was ¿ 95%. The following variables were compared for significance: pathologist, nuclear grade, histologic grade, margins, lymphovascular invasion, tumor type (ductal versus lobular), and estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor values.

The power to detect between-group differences in DNA methylation using bisulfite-sequencing approaches is influenced by both experimental (e.g. read depth, missing data and sample size) and biological (e.g. mean level of DNA methylation and difference between groups) parameters. There is, however, no consensus about the optimal thresholds for filtering bisulfite sequencing data with implications for the reproducibility of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We used a large reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) dataset to assess the distribution of read depth across DNA methylation sites and the extent of missing data. To investigate how various study variables influence power to identify DNA methylation differences between groups, we developed a framework for simulating bisulfite sequencing data. As expected, sequencing read depth, group size, and the magnitude of DNA methylation difference between groups all impacted upon statistical power. The influence on power was not dependent on one specific parameter, but reflected the combination of study-specific variables. As a resource to the community, we have developed a tool, POWEREDBiSeq, which utilizes our simulation framework to predict study-specific power for the identification of DNAm differences between groups, taking into account user-defined read depth filtering parameters and the minimum sample size per group.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our data-driven approach highlights the importance of filtering bisulfite-sequencing data by minimum read depth and illustrates how the choice of threshold is influenced by the specific study design and the expected differences between groups being compared. The POWEREDBiSeq tool, which can be applied to different types of bisulfite sequencing data (e.g. RRBS, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), targeted bisulfite sequencing and amplicon-based bisulfite sequencing), can help users identify the level of data filtering needed to optimize power and aims to improve the reproducibility of bisulfite sequencing studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Seiler Vellame","given":"Dorothea"},{"family":"Castanho","given":"Isabel"},{"family":"Dahir","given":"Aisha"},{"family":"Mill","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Hannon","given":"Eilis"}],"citation-key":"seilervellameCharacterizingPropertiesBisulfite2021","container-title":"BMC Genomics","container-title-short":"BMC Genomics","DOI":"10.1186/s12864-021-07721-z","ISSN":"1471-2164","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"446","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Characterizing the properties of bisulfite sequencing data: maximizing power and sensitivity to identify between-group differences in DNA methylation","title-short":"Characterizing the properties of bisulfite sequencing data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07721-z","volume":"22"},

High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing techniques have emerged as powerful tools to identify and characterize cell types in complex and heterogeneous tissues. However, extracting intact cells from tissues and organs is often technically challenging or impossible, for example in heart or brain tissue. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing provides an alternative way to obtain transcriptome profiles of such tissues. To systematically assess the differences between high-throughput single-cell and single-nuclei RNA-seq approaches, we compared Drop-seq and DroNc-seq, two microfluidic-based 3′ RNA capture technologies that profile total cellular and nuclear RNA, respectively, during a time course experiment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiating into cardiomyocytes. Clustering of time-series transcriptomes from Drop-seq and DroNc-seq revealed six distinct cell types, five of which were found in both techniques. Furthermore, single-cell trajectories reconstructed from both techniques reproduced expected differentiation dynamics. We then applied DroNc-seq to postmortem heart tissue to test its performance on heterogeneous human tissue samples. Our data confirm that DroNc-seq yields similar results to Drop-seq on matched samples and can be successfully used to generate reference maps for the human cell atlas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Selewa","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Dohn","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Eckart","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Lozano","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Bingqing"},{"family":"Gauchat","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Elorbany","given":"Reem"},{"family":"Rhodes","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Burnett","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Gilad","given":"Yoav"},{"family":"Pott","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Basu","given":"Anindita"}],"citation-key":"selewaSystematicComparisonHighthroughput2020","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-020-58327-6","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,30]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1535","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Systematic Comparison of High-throughput Single-Cell and Single-Nucleus Transcriptomes during Cardiomyocyte Differentiation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58327-6","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"SelfsupervisedDeepLearning","abstract":"Deep learning in bioinformatics is often limited to problems where extensive amounts of labeled data are available for supervised classification. By exploiting unlabeled data, self-supervised learning techniques can improve the performance of machine learning models in the presence of limited labeled data. Although many self-supervised learning methods have been suggested before, they have failed to exploit the unique characteristics of genomic data. Therefore, we introduce Self-GenomeNet, a self-supervised learning technique that is custom-tailored for genomic data. Self-GenomeNet leverages reverse-complement sequences and effectively learns short- and long-term dependencies by predicting targets of different lengths. Self-GenomeNet performs better than other self-supervised methods in data-scarce genomic tasks and outperforms standard supervised training with ~10 times fewer labeled training data. Furthermore, the learned representations generalize well to new datasets and tasks. These findings suggest that Self-GenomeNet is well suited for large-scale, unlabeled genomic datasets and could substantially improve the performance of genomic models. Self-GenomeNet, a self-supervised learning technique, is trained by predicting unlabeled reverse-complement genome sequences of different lengths and improves the performance of models substantially when a limited amount of labeled data is available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"citation-key":"SelfsupervisedDeepLearning","title":"A self-supervised deep learning method for data-efficient training in genomics | Communications Biology","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05310-2"},
  {"id":"selig_2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Schwarz’s criterion, also known as the Bayesian Information Criterion or BIC, is commonly used for model selection in logistic regression due to its simple intuitive formula. For tests of nested hypotheses in independent and identically distributed data as well as in Normal linear regression, previous results have motivated use of Schwarz’s criterion by its consistent approximation to the Bayes factor (BF), defined as the ratio of posterior to prior model odds. Furthermore, under construction of an intuitive unit-information prior for the parameters of interest to test for inclusion in the nested models, previous results have shown that Schwarz’s criterion approximates the BF to higher order in the neighborhood of the simpler nested model. This paper extends these results to univariate and multivariate logistic regression, providing approximations to the BF for arbitrary prior distributions and definitions of the unit-information prior corresponding to Schwarz’s approximation. Simulations show accuracies of the approximations for small samples sizes as well as comparisons to conclusions from frequentist testing. We present an application in prostate cancer, the motivating setting for our work, which illustrates the approximation for large data sets in a practical example.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Selig","given":"Katharina"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Ankerst","given":"Donna"}],"citation-key":"selig_2021","container-title":"The International Journal of Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1515/ijb-2020-0045","ISSN":"1557-4679","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,24]]},"language":"en","page":"241-266","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Bayesian information criterion approximations to Bayes factors for univariate and multivariate logistic regression models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ijb-2020-0045/html","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"semenkovichGenomicApproachesCancer2023","abstract":"Liquid biopsies using cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are being used frequently in both research and clinical settings. ctDNA can be used to identify actionable mutations to personalize systemic therapy, detect post-treatment minimal residual disease (MRD), and predict responses to immunotherapy. ctDNA can also be isolated from a range of different biofluids, with the possibility of detecting locoregional MRD with increased sensitivity if sampling more proximally than blood plasma. However, ctDNA detection remains challenging in early-stage and post-treatment MRD settings where ctDNA levels are minuscule giving a high risk for false negative results, which is balanced with the risk of false positive results from clonal hematopoiesis. To address these challenges, researchers have developed ever-more elegant approaches to lower the limit of detection (LOD) of ctDNA assays toward the part-per-million range and boost assay sensitivity and specificity by reducing sources of low-level technical and biological noise, and by harnessing specific genomic and epigenomic features of ctDNA. In this review, we highlight a range of modern assays for ctDNA analysis, including advancements made to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We further highlight the challenge of detecting ultra-rare tumor-associated variants, overcoming which will improve the sensitivity of post-treatment MRD detection and open a new frontier of personalized adjuvant treatment decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Semenkovich","given":"Nicholas P"},{"family":"Szymanski","given":"Jeffrey J"},{"family":"Earland","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Chauhan","given":"Pradeep S"},{"family":"Pellini","given":"Bruna"},{"family":"Chaudhuri","given":"Aadel A"}],"citation-key":"semenkovichGenomicApproachesCancer2023","container-title":"Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1136/jitc-2022-006284","ISSN":"2051-1426","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",6]]},"language":"en","page":"e006284","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genomic approaches to cancer and minimal residual disease detection using circulating tumor DNA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jitc.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jitc-2022-006284","volume":"11"},

We demonstrate the interpretability and flexibility of VEGA in diverse biological contexts, by integrating various sources of biological abstractions such as pathways, gene regulatory networks and cell type identities in the latent space of our model.

  {"id":"sfakianos:2024","abstract":"Background and objective\nDespite curative-intent radical cystectomy (RC), patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are at high risk of recurrence. Biomarkers are urgently needed to refine prognostication and selection of appropriate perioperative systemic therapies. Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) results in a multicenter cohort of patients with bladder cancer who underwent RC.\nMethods\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of real-world data for a commercial ctDNA test (Signatera; Natera, Austin, TX, USA) performed in 167 patients (852 plasma samples) before RC and during molecular residual disease (MRD; adjuvant decision) and surveillance windows. We assessed the correlation between recurrence and ctDNA status before and after RC using Cox regression analysis.\nResults and limitations\nDuring study-defined postoperative MRD and surveillance windows, detectable ctDNA was associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) when compared to undetectable ctDNA (MRD: hazard ratio 6.93; p < 0.001; surveillance: hazard ratio 23.02; p < 0.001). Of note, patients with undetectable ctDNA did not appear to benefit from adjuvant therapy (p = 0.34). Detectable ctDNA in the pre-RC (p = 0.045), MRD (p = 0.002), and surveillance (p < 0.001) windows was the only risk factor independently associated with shorter DFS. Limitations include the retrospective and nonrandomized nature of the study.\nConclusions\nctDNA testing in patients with bladder cancer undergoing RC was prognostic and potentially predictive. Identification of patients at high risk of recurrence may aid in patient counseling and decision-making.\nPatient summary\nWe found that outcomes for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are strongly linked to detection of tumor DNA in blood samples.

Our new results reveal an asymptotic conical structure in critical sample eigendirections under the spike models with distinguishable (or indistinguishable) eigenvalues, when the sample size and/or the number of variables (or dimension) tend to infinity. The consistency of the sample eigenvectors relative to their population counterparts is determined by the ratio between the dimension and the product of the sample size with the spike size. When this ratio converges to a nonzero constant, the sample eigenvector converges to a cone, with a certain angle to its corresponding population eigenvector. In the High Dimension, Low Sample Size case, the angle between the sample eigenvector and its population counterpart converges to a limiting distribution. Several generalizations of the multi-spike covariance models are also explored, and additional theoretical results are presented.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Haipeng"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Hongtu"},{"family":"Marron","given":"J.

  {"id":"shenExplainableSurvivalAnalysis2022","abstract":"Image-based survival prediction models can facilitate doctors in diagnosing and treating cancer patients. With the advance of digital pathology technologies, the big whole slide images (WSIs) provide increasing resolution and more details for diagnosis. However, the gigabyte-size WSIs would make most models computationally infeasible. To this end, instead of using the complete WSIs, most of existing models only use a pre-selected subset of key patches or patch clusters as input, which might fail to completely capture the patient's tumor morphology. In this work, we aim to develop a novel survival analysis model to fully utilize the complete WSI information. We show that the use of a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone, together with convolution operations involved in it, is an effective framework to improve the prediction performance. Additionally, we present a post-hoc explainable method to identify the most salient patches and distinct morphology features, making the model more faithful and the results easier to comprehend by human users. Evaluations on two large cancer datasets show that our proposed model is more effective and has better interpretability for survival prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Yifan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Li"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Zhihao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zongyi"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Guixiang"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Jiyan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Qingfeng"}],"citation-key":"shenExplainableSurvivalAnalysis2022","container-title":"Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1609/aaai.v36i2.20118","ISSN":"2374-3468","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2022 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","number":"2","page":"2207-2215","source":"ojs.aaai.org","title":"Explainable Survival Analysis with Convolution-Involved Vision Transformer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/20118","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"Sherman2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Bethesda System (TBS) along with its companion atlas was updated in 2001 to improve standardization, clarity, and reproducibility of cervical cytology reporting. METHODS: The authors used a novel web-based format to compare assessments of 77 images demonstrating a range of classical and borderline cytologic changes by a self-selected group of United States cytotechnologists (n = 216) and pathologists (n = 185). RESULTS: Participants were highly experienced, with 71.2% of cytotechnologists and 53.0% of pathologists reporting ¿10 years of practice. The mean percentage of exact agreement with the panel was slightly though significantly higher for cytotechnologists (57.0%) compared with pathologists (53.4%), adjusted for experience (P = .004); cervical cytology percentage effort (P = .0005); or cervical accession volume (P = .0002). Compared with the TBS panel, exact agreement was achieved for 55.1% of image ratings compared with 82.3% agreement at the level of Negative vs non-Negative for images with a single-panel interpretation. Agreement with the panel was highest for images classified as Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion and lowest for Atypical Squamous Cells qualified as either of Undetermined Significance or Cannot Exclude a High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion. Reviewers were less sensitive in identifying high-grade glandular lesions than they were in identifying high-grade squamous lesions at any threshold (P ¡ .001). CONCLUSIONS: Morphologic appearances of images were more important determinants than participants' academic or professional degrees with regard to interobserver reproducibility in classifying cervical cytology images. Experienced cytotechnologists and pathologists performed similarly. Participants achieved higher sensitivity for identifying high-grade squamous lesions than they did for high-grade glandular lesions. These findings demonstrated that web-based studies may be useful in assessing interobserver agreement in classifying images.","author":[{"family":"Sherman","given":"Mark E"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Schiffman","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Nayar","given":"Ritu"},{"family":"Solomon","given":"Diane"}],"citation-key":"Sherman2007","container-title":"Cancer","DOI":"10.1002/cncr.22423","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"0008-543X (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",2]]},"page":"15-25","PMID":"17186503","publisher-place":"United States","title":"The bethesda interobserver reproducibility study (BIRST): a web-based assessment of the bethesda 2001 system for classifying cervical cytology.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cncr.22423","volume":"111"},

To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sikkema","given":"L"},{"family":"Strobl","given":"D"},{"family":"Zappia","given":"L"},{"family":"Madissoon","given":"E"},{"family":"Markov","given":"Ns"},{"family":"Zaragosi","given":"L"},{"family":"Ansari","given":"M"},{"family":"Arguel","given":"M"},{"family":"Apperloo","given":"L"},{"family":"Bécavin","given":"C"},{"family":"Berg","given":"M"},{"family":"Chichelnitskiy","given":"E"},{"family":"Chung","given":"M"},{"family":"Collin","given":"A"},{"family":"Gay","given":"Aca"},{"family":"Hooshiar Kashani","given":"B"},{"family":"Jain","given":"M"},{"family":"Kapellos","given":"T"},{"family":"Kole","given":"Tm"},{"family":"Mayr","given":"C"},{"family":"Papen","given":"M","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Peter","given":"L"},{"family":"Ramírez-Suástegui","given":"C"},{"family":"Schniering","given":"J"},{"family":"Taylor","given":"C"},{"family":"Walzthoeni","given":"T"},{"family":"Xu","given":"C"},{"family":"Bui","given":"Lt"},{"family":"Donno","given":"C","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Dony","given":"L"},{"family":"Guo","given":"M"},{"family":"Gutierrez","given":"Aj"},{"family":"Heumos","given":"L"},{"family":"Huang","given":"N"},{"family":"Ibarra","given":"I"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"N"},{"family":"Kadur Lakshminarasimha Murthy","given":"P"},{"family":"Lotfollahi","given":"M"},{"family":"Tabib","given":"T"},{"family":"Talavera-Lopez","given":"C"},{"family":"Travaglini","given":"K"},{"family":"Wilbrey-Clark","given":"A"},{"family":"Worlock","given":"Kb"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"M"},{"literal":"Lung Biological Network Consortium"},{"family":"Desai","given":"T"},{"family":"Eickelberg","given":"O"},{"family":"Falk","given":"C"},{"family":"Kaminski","given":"N"},{"family":"Krasnow","given":"M"},{"family":"Lafyatis","given":"R"},{"family":"Nikolíc","given":"M"},{"family":"Powell","given":"J"},{"family":"Rajagopal","given":"J"},{"family":"Rozenblatt-Rosen","given":"O"},{"family":"Seibold","given":"Ma"},{"family":"Sheppard","given":"D"},{"family":"Shepherd","given":"D"},{"family":"Teichmann","given":"Sa"},{"family":"Tsankov","given":"A"},{"family":"Whitsett","given":"J"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Y"},{"family":"Banovich","given":"Ne"},{"family":"Barbry","given":"P"},{"family":"Duong","given":"Te"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Kb"},{"family":"Kropski","given":"Ja"},{"family":"Pe’er","given":"D"},{"family":"Schiller","given":"Hb"},{"family":"Tata","given":"Pr"},{"family":"Schultze","given":"Jl"},{"family":"Misharin","given":"Av"},{"family":"Nawijn","given":"Mc"},{"family":"Luecken","given":"Md"},{"family":"Theis","given":"F"}],"citation-key":"sikkemaIntegratedCellAtlas2022","DOI":"10.1101/2022.03.10.483747","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,11]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Cell Biology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An integrated cell atlas of the human lung in health and disease","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2022.03.10.483747"},

However, the methods used for analysing and presenting results from IPD meta-analyses have received little discussion.\n            Methods We review 44 IPD meta-analyses published during the years 1999–2001. We summarize whether they obtained all the data they sought, what types of approaches were used in the analysis, including assumptions of common or random effects, and how they examined the effects of covariates.\n            Results Twenty-four out of 44 analyses focused on time-to-event outcomes, and most analyses (28) estimated treatment effects within each trial and then combined the results assuming a common treatment effect across trials. Three analyses failed to stratify by trial, analysing the data is if they came from a single mega-trial. Only nine analyses used random effects methods. Covariate-treatment interactions were generally investigated by subgrouping patients. Seven of the meta-analyses included data from less than 80% of the randomized patients sought, but did not address the resulting potential biases.\n            Conclusions Although IPD meta-analyses have many advantages in assessing the effects of health care, there are several aspects that could be further developed to make fuller use of the potential of these time-consuming projects. In particular, IPD could be used to more fully investigate the influence of covariates on heterogeneity of treatment effects, both within and between trials. The impact of heterogeneity, or use of random effects, are seldom discussed. There is thus considerable scope for enhancing the methods of analysis and presentation of IPD meta-analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Simmonds","given":"Mark C"},{"family":"Higginsa","given":"Julian P T"},{"family":"Stewartb","given":"Lesley A"},{"family":"Tierneyb","given":"Jayne F"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Mike J"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Simon G"}],"citation-key":"simmondsMetaanalysisIndividualPatient2005","container-title":"Clinical Trials","container-title-short":"Clinical Trials","DOI":"10.1191/1740774505cn087oa","ISSN":"1740-7745, 1740-7753","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6]]},"language":"en","page":"209-217","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials: a review of methods used in practice","title-short":"Meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomized trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1740774505cn087oa","volume":"2"},

We review here methodology for classifying patients into survival risk groups and for using cross-validation to evaluate such classifications. Measures of discrimination for survival risk models include separation of survival curves, time-dependent ROC curves and Harrell’s concordance index. For high-dimensional data applications, however, computing these measures as re-substitution statistics on the same data used for model development results in highly biased estimates. Most developments in methodology for survival risk modeling with high-dimensional data have utilized separate test data sets for model evaluation. Cross-validation has sometimes been used for optimization of tuning parameters. In many applications, however, the data available are too limited for effective division into training and test sets and consequently authors have often either reported re-substitution statistics or analyzed their data using binary classification methods in order to utilize familiar cross-validation. In this article we have tried to indicate how to utilize cross-validation for the evaluation of survival risk models; specifically how to compute cross-validated estimates of survival distributions for predicted risk groups and how to compute cross-validated time-dependent ROC curves.

But what does it mean for a machine learning model to be interpretable by humans, and how can this be assessed? We focus on two definitions of interpretability that have been introduced in the machine learning literature: simulatability (a user's ability to run a model on a given input) and \"what if\" local explainability (a user's ability to correctly determine a model's prediction under local changes to the input, given knowledge of the model's original prediction). Through a user study with 1,000 participants, we test whether humans perform well on tasks that mimic the definitions of simulatability and \"what if\" local explainability on models that are typically considered locally interpretable. To track the relative interpretability of models, we employ a simple metric, the runtime operation count on the simulatability task. We find evidence that as the number of operations increases, participant accuracy on the local interpretability tasks decreases. In addition, this evidence is consistent with the common intuition that decision trees and logistic regression models are interpretable and are more interpretable than neural networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Slack","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Friedler","given":"Sorelle A."},{"family":"Scheidegger","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Roy","given":"Chitradeep Dutta"}],"citation-key":"slackAssessingLocalInterpretability2019","container-title":"arXiv.org","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,9]]},"language":"en","title":"Assessing the Local Interpretability of Machine Learning Models","type":"webpage","URL":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03501v2"},

We analyzed 216,490 cells and nuclei from 40 samples across 23 specimens spanning eight tumor types of varying tissue and sample characteristics. We evaluated protocols by cell and nucleus quality, recovery rate and cellular composition. scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq from matched samples recovered the same cell types, but at different proportions.

Expert commentary: Active surveillance (AS) in localized prostate cancer is an accepted strategy in patients with very low-risk prostate cancer. Many more patients may benefit from watchful waiting, and include patients of higher clinical stage and grade, however selection criteria have to be optimized and early recognition of transformation from localized to lethal disease has to be improved by addition of molecular biomarkers.

Bayesian mixed treatment comparison (MTC) methods were used to determine the relative efficacy and safety among the treatments within each pain condition.\n\nRESULTS:Fifty studies were identified: 33 PHN, 2 MS-related pain, 3 CPSP, 3 posttraumatic pain and 9 HIV-related NeP. Data from 28 PHN studies including 21 interventions and 4317 patients were included into the PHN MTC. Of treatments studied in ≥ 50 patients, opioids had the greatest mean pain reduction of -1.70 vs. placebo on an 11-point numeric rating scale. Pregabalin ≥ 300 mg/day was most effective for ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction [relative risk (RR) vs. placebo = 2.44 and 2.13, respectively]. Data identified for MS-related pain, CPSP, posttraumatic pain and HIV-related NeP were sparse; only 7 of 17 studies had ≥ 50 patients. Adverse events (AEs) and discontinuations for most treatments were not significantly greater than placebo except in PHN, where 8 of 12 treatments had higher risks of AEs compared with placebo and tricyclic antidepressants and opioids had higher risk of discontinuation compared with placebo.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:Guideline-recommended treatments for PHN were more effective than placebo on the pain NRS and for ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% pain reduction. Although guidelines exist for the management of less common NeP conditions, little published evidence supports them. These results highlight the need for additional evaluations and more complete reporting of outcomes to help guide physicians' treatment selections.","author":[{"family":"Snedecor","given":"S J"},{"family":"Sudharshan","given":"L"},{"family":"Cappelleri","given":"J C"},{"family":"Sadosky","given":"A"},{"family":"Desai","given":"P"},{"family":"Jalundhwala","given":"Y"},{"family":"Botteman","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Snedecor2014","container-title":"International journal of clinical practice","event-place":"Pharmerit International, Bethesda, MD, USA.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher-place":"Pharmerit International, Bethesda, MD, USA.","title":"Systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacological therapies for pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia and less common neuropathic conditions.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=24698515&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks"},

  {"id":"sondhi:2021","abstract":"Background\nStatistical inference based on small datasets, commonly found in precision oncology, is subject to low power and high uncertainty. In these settings, drawing strong conclusions about future research utility is difficult when using standard inferential measures. It is therefore important to better quantify the uncertainty associated with both significant and non-significant results based on small sample sizes.\n\nMethods\nWe developed a new method, Bayesian Additional Evidence (BAE), that determines (1) how much additional supportive evidence is needed for a non-significant result to reach Bayesian posterior credibility, or (2) how much additional opposing evidence is needed to render a significant result non-credible. Although based in Bayesian analysis, a prior distribution is not needed; instead, the tipping point output is compared to reasonable effect ranges to draw conclusions. We demonstrate our approach in a comparative effectiveness analysis comparing two treatments in a real world biomarker-defined cohort, and provide guidelines for how to apply BAE in practice.\n\nResults\nOur initial comparative effectiveness analysis results in a hazard ratio of 0.31 with 95% confidence interval (0.09, 1.1). Applying BAE to this result yields a tipping point of 0.54; thus, an observed hazard ratio of 0.54 or smaller in a replication study would result in posterior credibility for the treatment association. Given that effect sizes in this range are not extreme, and that supportive evidence exists from a similar published study, we conclude that this problem is worthy of further research.\n\nConclusions\nOur proposed method provides a useful framework for interpreting analytic results from small datasets. This can assist researchers in deciding how to interpret and continue their investigations based on an initial analysis that has high uncertainty. Although we illustrated its use in estimating parameters based on time-to-event outcomes, BAE easily applies to any normally-distributed estimator, such as those used for analyzing binary or continuous outcomes.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12874-021-01432-5.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sondhi","given":"Arjun"},{"family":"Segal","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Snider","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Humblet","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"McCusker","given":"Margaret"}],"citation-key":"sondhi:2021","container-title":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","container-title-short":"BMC Med Res Methodol","DOI":"10.1186/s12874-021-01432-5","ISSN":"1471-2288","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"page":"221","PMCID":"PMC8543928","PMID":"34689747","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Bayesian additional evidence for decision making under small sample uncertainty","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8543928/","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"sonesonBatchEffectConfounding2014","abstract":"Background With the large amount of biological data that is currently publicly available, many investigators combine multiple data sets to increase the sample size and potentially also the power of their analyses. However, technical differences (“batch effects”) as well as differences in sample composition between the data sets may significantly affect the ability to draw generalizable conclusions from such studies. Focus The current study focuses on the construction of classifiers, and the use of cross-validation to estimate their performance. In particular, we investigate the impact of batch effects and differences in sample composition between batches on the accuracy of the classification performance estimate obtained via cross-validation. The focus on estimation bias is a main difference compared to previous studies, which have mostly focused on the predictive performance and how it relates to the presence of batch effects. Data We work on simulated data sets. To have realistic intensity distributions, we use real gene expression data as the basis for our simulation. Random samples from this expression matrix are selected and assigned to group 1 (e.g., ‘control’) or group 2 (e.g., ‘treated’). We introduce batch effects and select some features to be differentially expressed between the two groups. We consider several scenarios for our study, most importantly different levels of confounding between groups and batch effects. Methods We focus on well-known classifiers: logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and Random Forests (RF). Feature selection is performed with the Wilcoxon test or the lasso. Parameter tuning and feature selection, as well as the estimation of the prediction performance of each classifier, is performed within a nested cross-validation scheme. The estimated classification performance is then compared to what is obtained when applying the classifier to independent data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Soneson","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Gerster","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Delorenzi","given":"Mauro"}],"citation-key":"sonesonBatchEffectConfounding2014","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0100335","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e100335","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Batch Effect Confounding Leads to Strong Bias in Performance Estimates Obtained by Cross-Validation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100335","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"song_2022","abstract":"We consider evaluating new or more accurately measured predictive biomarkers for treatment selection based on a previous clinical trial involving standard biomarkers. Instead of rerunning the clinical trial with the new biomarkers, we propose a more efficient approach which requires only either conducting a reproducibility study in which the new biomarkers and standard biomarkers are both measured on a set of patient samples, or adopting replicated measures of the error-contaminated standard biomarkers in the original study. This approach is easier to conduct and much less expensive than studies that require new samples from patients randomized to the intervention. In addition, it makes it possible to perform the estimation of the clinical performance quickly, since there will be no requirement to wait for events to occur as would be the case with prospective validation. The treatment selection is assessed via a working model, but the proposed estimator of the mean restricted lifetime is valid even if the working model is misspecified.

Understanding how immunological alterations between lung diseases provide opportunities for immunotherapy. Exhausted T cells play a key role of immune suppression in lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was proved in our previous study. The present study aims to furthermore define molecular landscapes and heterogeneity of systemic immune cell target proteomic and transcriptomic profiles and interactions between circulating immune cells and lung residential cells in various lung diseases. We firstly measured target proteomic profiles of circulating immune cells from healthy volunteers and patients with stable pneumonia, stable asthma, acute asthma, acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer, using single-cell analysis by cytometry by time-of-flight with 42 antibodies. The nine immune cells landscape was mapped among those respiratory system diseases, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells, B cells, eosinophil, γδT cells, monocytes, neutrophil and natural killer cells. The double-negative T cells and exhausted CD4+ central memory T cells subset were identified in patients with acute pneumonia. This T subset expressed higher levels of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim3) and T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) in patients with acute pneumonia and stable pneumonia. Biological processes and pathways of immune cells including immune response activation, regulation of cell cycle and pathways in cancer in peripheral blood immune cells were defined by bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The heterogeneity among immune cells including CD4+, CD8+ T cells and NK T cells by single immune cell RNA-seq with significant difference was found by single-cell sequencing. The effect of interstitial telocytes on the immune cell types and immune function was finally studied and the expressions of CD8a and chemokine C–C motif receptor 7 (CCR7) were increased significantly in co-cultured groups. Our data indicate that proteomic and transcriptomic profiles and heterogeneity of circulating immune cells provides new insights for understanding new molecular mechanisms of immune cell function, interaction and modulation as a source to identify and develop biomarkers and targets for lung diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Dongli"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Furong"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Huirong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Liyang"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhenhua"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Meiling"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Lihua"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Song","given":"Zhenju"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Duojiao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiangdong"}],"citation-key":"songCellularCensusHuman2021","container-title":"Clinical and Translational Medicine","DOI":"10.1002/ctm2.579","ISSN":"2001-1326","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e579","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A cellular census of human peripheral immune cells identifies novel cell states in lung diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ctm2.579","volume":"11"},

A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers, three fibroadenomas, and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. As reported previously, the cancers could be classified into a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups, each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets: first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect intrinsic properties of the tumors and, second, a gene set that highly correlated with patient outcome. Survival analyses on a subcohort of patients with locally advanced breast cancer uniformly treated in a prospective study showed significantly different outcomes for the patients belonging to the various groups, including a poor prognosis for the basal-like subtype and a significant difference in outcome for the two estrogen receptor-positive groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Sørlie","given":"Therese"},{"family":"Perou","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Aas","given":"Turid"},{"family":"Geisler","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Johnsen","given":"Hilde"},{"family":"Hastie","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Eisen","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Rijn","given":"Matt","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Jeffrey","given":"Stefanie S."},{"family":"Thorsen","given":"Thor"},{"family":"Quist","given":"Hanne"},{"family":"Matese","given":"John C."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick O."},{"family":"Botstein","given":"David"},{"family":"Lønning","given":"Per Eystein"},{"family":"Børresen-Dale","given":"Anne-Lise"}],"citation-key":"sorlie:2001","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.191367098","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9,11]]},"page":"10869-10874","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Gene expression patterns of breast carcinomas distinguish tumor subclasses with clinical implications","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.191367098","volume":"98"},

Such data are often analyzed using Cox models for the cause-specific hazard function or Fine and Gray models for the subdistribution hazard. In practice, regression relationships in competing risks data are often complex and may include nonlinear functions of covariates, interactions, high-dimensional parameter spaces and nonproportional cause-specific, or subdistribution, hazards. Model misspecification can lead to poor predictive performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach: flexible prediction modeling of competing risks data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). We study the simulation performance in two-sample scenarios as well as a complex regression setting, and benchmark its performance against standard regression techniques as well as random survival forests.

  {"id":"sparling:2006","abstract":"We present a parametric family of regression models for interval-censored event-time (survival) data that accomodates both fixed (e.g. baseline) and time-dependent covariates. The model employs a three-parameter family of survival distributions that includes the Weibull, negative binomial, and log-logistic distributions as special cases, and can be applied to data with left, right, interval, or non-censored event times. Standard methods, such as Newton–Raphson, can be employed to estimate the model and the resulting estimates have an asymptotically normal distribution about the true values with a covariance matrix that is consistently estimated by the information function. The deviance function is described to assess model fit and a robust sandwich estimate of the covariance may also be employed to provide asymptotically robust inferences when the model assumptions do not apply. Spline functions may also be employed to allow for non-linear covariates. The model is applied to data from a long-term study of type 1 diabetes to describe the effects of longitudinal measures of glycemia (HbA1c) over time (the time-dependent covariate) on the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy (eye disease), an interval-censored event-time outcome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Sparling","given":"Yvonne H."},{"family":"Younes","given":"Naji"},{"family":"Lachin","given":"John M."},{"family":"Bautista","given":"Oliver M."}],"citation-key":"sparling:2006","container-title":"Biostatistics","container-title-short":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxj028","ISSN":"1465-4644","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"page":"599-614","source":"Silverchair","title":"Parametric survival models for interval-censored data with time-dependent covariates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxj028","volume":"7"},

Of the 11 types of RNA, the translational and clinical focus in prostate cancer has been primarily on mRNA and lncRNA. The most common use of RNA-based biomarkers is to assess a tumor’s aggressiveness or treatment sensitivity. However, multiple gene expression signatures have been developed to capture the functional state that results from canonical DNA alterations, including ERG fusions, SPOP mutations, and Rb loss. More commonly, these biomarkers have been used to develop over 30 prognostic gene expression signatures, three of which are now commercially available and being increasingly incorporated into clinical trials. In parallel, the ability to use microarray and RNAseq technologies have allowed high throughput methods of performing whole transcriptomic analyses. This has enabled the discovery and training of numerous predictive biomarker signatures rooted in biologically informed pathways to determine which tumors are more sensitive or resistant to various treatments, including androgen-deprivation therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and PARP inhibition.

The capabilities of the proposed software encompass understanding and diagnosing survival models, which can lead to their improvement. By revealing insights into the decision-making process, such as variable effects and importances, survex enables the assessment of model reliability and the detection of biases. Thus, transparency and responsibility may be promoted in sensitive areas, such as biomedical research and healthcare applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Spytek","given":"Mikołaj"},{"family":"Krzyziński","given":"Mateusz"},{"family":"Langbein","given":"Sophie Hanna"},{"family":"Baniecki","given":"Hubert"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Marvin N."},{"family":"Biecek","given":"Przemysław"}],"citation-key":"spytekSurvexPackageExplaining2023","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2308.16113","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,30]]},"number":"arXiv:2308.16113","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"survex: an R package for explaining machine learning survival models","title-short":"survex","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16113"},

In this paper, we explore the use of Machine Learning Models in the field of Survival Analysis using right censored Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset. For this purpose, we first identify the top most important features responsible for death due to heart failure using Recursive Feature Elimination and then see how Machine Learning models can be adapted to improve the time-to-event analysis outcomes. To deal with this, Machine Learning Models are modified using the techniques Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW) and IPCW Bagging and are trained using the processed dataset alongside various survival analysis models. Area Under the time-dependent ROC (AUC) is used as a performance metric. The results reveal that the average AUC value for Survival Analysis Models is 0.51 while that of Machine Learning Models processed using IPCW increased to 0.80, and those processed using IPCW Bagging increased by 0.82. This reflects that Machine Learning models outperform Survival Analysis models in the case of time-to-event analysis of right censored dataset, and hence, are better indicators of risk of heart disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Srujana","given":"B."},{"family":"Verma","given":"Dhananjay"},{"family":"Naqvi","given":"Sameen"}],"citation-key":"srujanaMachineLearningVs2022","container-title":"Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation","DOI":"10.1080/03610918.2022.2060510","ISSN":"0361-0918","issue":"0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,11]]},"page":"1-18","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Machine Learning vs. Survival Analysis Models: a study on right censored heart failure data","title-short":"Machine Learning vs. Survival Analysis Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2022.2060510","volume":"0"},

  {"id":"Stanley2016","abstract":"Abstract Background: The Cox Proportional Hazards(PH) model is commonest survival data model used in clinical trials. However, little is known as to whether or not this approach is robust to the size of the study. We compared performance of Cox, Weibull, Exponential and Frailty models in a randomized study that had a small sample size in general. Methods: Models were fitted to data from a three-arm randomized efficacy trial of Kaposi's sarcoma at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) of children aged <16 years. Patients were randomized to receive Vincristine monotherapy or Etoposide or Vincristine plus Bleomycin. The Cox, Weibull, Exponential and Frailty models were fitted to the data to obtain the adjusted effect of treatment on survival. The performance of models were compared using the Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC). Plots of log-log of survival against log of survival time, and the Schoenfeld's global tests were used to test suitability of the PH assumption. Results: Ninety-two patients were available for analyses of which 64% were males, the mean age was 8 years (SD=2.8years) and 89% were HIV positive. Exponential model was the best fitting method with AIC=174.1. Children treated with Vincristine monotherapy survived evidently poorly compared with those on Etoposide (HR=5.8, p=0.04). Conclusion: Exponential models can elicit more valid results than semi-parametric CoxPH model in a clinical trial with small sample size. This emphasizes the fact that when models are fitted to data, it is good practice to assess the goodness of fit and where appropriate alternative models should be fitted.","author":[{"family":"Stanley","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Molyneux","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Mukaka","given":"Mavuto"}],"citation-key":"Stanley2016","container-title":"Journal of Medical Statistics and Informatics","DOI":"10.7243/2053-7662-4-2","ISSN":"2053-7662","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"number":"1","page":"2","title":"Comparison of performance of exponential, Cox proportional hazards, weibull and frailty survival models for analysis of small sample size data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.hoajonline.com/medicalstat/2053-7662/4/2","volume":"4"},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Steegen","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Tuerlinckx","given":"Francis"},{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Vanpaemel","given":"Wolf"}],"citation-key":"steegen:2016","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect Psychol Sci","DOI":"10.1177/1745691616658637","ISSN":"1745-6916","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"702-712","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Increasing Transparency Through a Multiverse Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691616658637","volume":"11"},

Such courses can speed up the process of gaining statistical wisdom by giving students insight into the human propensity to make statistical errors, the meaning of a single test within a research project, ways in which p-values work and don't work as expected, the role of statistics in the lifecycle of science, and best practices for statistical communication. The course we have developed follows the story of how we use data to understand the world, leveraging simulation-based approaches to perform customized analyses and evaluate the behavior of statistical procedures.

  {"id":"stetson:2023","abstract":"Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) detection of molecular residual disease (MRD) in solid tumours correlates strongly with patient outcomes and is being adopted as a new clinical standard. ctDNA levels are known to correlate with tumor volume, and although the absolute levels vary across indication and histology, its analysis is driving the adoption of MRD. MRD assays must detect tumor when imaging cannot and, as such, require very high sensitivity to detect the low levels of ctDNA found after curative intent therapy. The minimum threshold is 0.01% Tumour Fraction but current methods like Archer and Signatera are limited by detection sensitivity resulting in some patients receiving a false negative call thereby missing out on earlier therapeutic intervention. Multiple vendors are increasing the number of somatic variants tracked in tumour-informed and personalized NGS assays, from tens to thousands of variants. Most recently, assays using other biological features of ctDNA, e.g methylation or fragmentome, have been developed at the LOD required for clinical utility. These uniformed, or tumour-naive and non-personalised assays may be more easily, and therefore more rapidly, adopted in the clinic. However, this rapid development in MRD assay technology results in significant challenges in benchmarking these new technologies for use in clinical trials. This is further complicated by the fact that previous reference materials have focused on somatic variants, and do not retain all of the epigenomic features assessed by newer technologies. In this Comments and Controversy paper, we detail what is known and what remains to be determined for optimal reference materials of MRD methods and provide opinions generated during three-years of MRD technology benchmarking in AstraZeneca Translational Medicine to help guide the community conversation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Stetson","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Labrousse","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Russell","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Shera","given":"David"},{"family":"Abbosh","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Dougherty","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Barrett","given":"J.

Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10% of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias.

Traditional meta-analysis (TMA) was used to compare each anti-TNF agent to placebo. Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to compare the effects of anti-TNF agents to placebo. In addition, sample sizes for comparative efficacy trials were calculated.\n\nRESULTS:Compared to placebo, TMA revealed that anti-TNF agents result in a higher likelihood of induction of remission and response (RR: 1.66, 95% CI: 1.17-2.36 and RR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.17-1.73, respectively) as well as maintenance of remission and response (RR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.51-2.09 and RR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.46-1.93, respectively). NMA found nonsignificant trends between infliximab and adalimumab or certolizumab pegol. Among subcutaneous therapies, NMA demonstrated superiority of adalimumab to certolizumab pegol for induction of remission (RR: 2.93, 95% CrI: 1.21-7.75). Sample size calculations suggest that adequately powered head-to-head comparative efficacy trials would require greater than 3000 patients.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:All anti-TNF agents are effective for induction and maintenance of response and remission in the treatment of CD. Although adalimumab is superior to certolizumab pegol for induction of remission, there is no evidence of clinical superiority among anti-TNF agents. Head-to-head trials among the anti-TNF agents are impractical in terms of size and cost.","author":[{"family":"Stidham","given":"R W"},{"family":"Lee","given":"T C H"},{"family":"Higgins","given":"P D R"},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"A R"},{"family":"Sussman","given":"D A"},{"family":"Singal","given":"A G"},{"family":"Elmunzer","given":"B J"},{"family":"Saini","given":"S D"},{"family":"Vijan","given":"S"},{"family":"Waljee","given":"A K"}],"citation-key":"Stidham2014","container-title":"Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics","event-place":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"number":"12","page":"1349-1362","publisher-place":"Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Health System, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.","title":"Systematic review with network meta-analysis: the efficacy of anti-TNF agents for the treatment of Crohn's disease.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=24749763&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"39"},

  {"id":"su_2013","abstract":"We review the applicability of Bayesian networks (BNs) for discovering relations between genes, environment, and disease. By translating probabilistic dependencies among variables into graphical models and vice versa, BNs provide a comprehensible and modular framework for representing complex systems. We first describe the Bayesian network approach and its applicability to understanding the genetic and environmental basis of disease. We then describe a variety of algorithms for learning the structure of a network from observational data. Because of their relevance to real-world applications, the topics of missing data and causal interpretation are emphasized. The BN approach is then exemplified through application to data from a population-based study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, USA. For didactical purposes, we intentionally keep this example simple. When applied to complete data records, we find only minor differences in the performance and results of different algorithms. Subsequent incorporation of partial records through application of the EM algorithm gives us greater power to detect relations. Allowing for network structures that depart from a strict causal interpretation also enhances our ability to discover complex associations including gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions. While BNs are already powerful tools for the genetic dissection of disease and generation of prognostic models, there remain some conceptual and computational challenges. These include the proper handling of continuous variables and unmeasured factors, the explicit incorporation of prior knowledge, and the evaluation and communication of the robustness of substantive conclusions to alternative assumptions and data manifestations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Su","given":"Chengwei"},{"family":"Andrew","given":"Angeline"},{"family":"Karagas","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Borsuk","given":"Mark E."}],"citation-key":"su_2013","container-title":"BioData Mining","container-title-short":"BioData Mining","DOI":"10.1186/1756-0381-6-6","ISSN":"1756-0381","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,21]]},"page":"6","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Using Bayesian networks to discover relations between genes, environment, and disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0381-6-6","volume":"6"},

Hundreds of bespoke methods have been developed in the past few years to deal with various aspects of single-cell analysis and consensus on the most appropriate methods to use under different settings is still emerging. Benchmarking the many methods is therefore of critical importance and since analysis of single-cell data usually involves multi-step pipelines, effective evaluation of pipelines involving different combinations of methods is required. Current benchmarks of single-cell methods are mostly implemented with ad-hoc code that is often difficult to reproduce or extend, and exhaustive manual coding of many combinations is infeasible in most instances. Therefore, new software is needed to manage pipeline benchmarking.The CellBench R software facilitates method comparisons in either a task-centric or combinatorial way to allow pipelines of methods to be evaluated in an effective manner. CellBench automatically runs combinations of methods, provides facilities for measuring running time and delivers output in tabular form which is highly compatible with tidyverse R packages for summary and visualization. Our software has enabled comprehensive benchmarking of single-cell RNA-seq normalization, imputation, clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration methods using various performance metrics obtained from data with available ground truth.

  {"id":"sudellJointModelsLongitudinal2016","abstract":"Background\nJoint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data are commonly used to simultaneously analyse correlated data in single study cases. Synthesis of evidence from multiple studies using meta-analysis is a natural next step but its feasibility depends heavily on the standard of reporting of joint models in the medical literature. During this review we aim to assess the current standard of reporting of joint models applied in the literature, and to determine whether current reporting standards would allow or hinder future aggregate data meta-analyses of model results.\n\nMethods\nWe undertook a literature review of non-methodological studies that involved joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event medical data. Study characteristics were extracted and an assessment of whether separate meta-analyses for longitudinal, time-to-event and association parameters were possible was made.\n\nResults\nThe 65 studies identified used a wide range of joint modelling methods in a selection of software. Identified studies concerned a variety of disease areas. The majority of studies reported adequate information to conduct a meta-analysis (67.7% for longitudinal parameter aggregate data meta-analysis, 69.2% for time-to-event parameter aggregate data meta-analysis, 76.9% for association parameter aggregate data meta-analysis). In some cases model structure was difficult to ascertain from the published reports.\n\nConclusions\nWhilst extraction of sufficient information to permit meta-analyses was possible in a majority of cases, the standard of reporting of joint models should be maintained and improved.

  {"id":"Sugihara2010","abstract":"In survival analysis, treatment effects are commonly evaluated based on survival curves and hazard ratios as causal treatment effects. In observational studies, these estimates may be biased due to confounding factors. The inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method based on the propensity score is one of the approaches utilized to adjust for confounding factors between binary treatment groups. As a generalization of this methodology, we developed an exact formula for an IPTW log-rank test based on the generalized propensity score for survival data. This makes it possible to compare the group differences of IPTW Kaplan–Meier estimators of survival curves using an IPTW log-rank test for multi-valued treatments. As causal treatment effects, the hazard ratio can be estimated using the IPTW approach. If the treatments correspond to ordered levels of a treatment, the proposed method can be easily extended to the analysis of treatment effect patterns with contrast statistics. In this paper, the proposed method is illustrated with data from the Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS), which investigated the primary preventive effects of pravastatin on coronary heart disease (CHD). The results of the proposed method suggested that pravastatin treatment reduces the risk of CHD and that compliance to pravastatin treatment is important for the prevention of CHD.","author":[{"family":"Sugihara","given":"Masahiro"}],"citation-key":"Sugihara2010","container-title":"Pharmaceutical Statistics","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"number":"1","page":"21-34","title":"Survival analysis using inverse probability of treatment weighted methods based on the generalized propensity score","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/pst.365","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"sun_2018","abstract":"It is well known that truncated survival data are subject to sampling bias, where the sampling weight depends on the underlying truncation time distribution. Recently, there has been a rising interest in developing methods to better exploit the information about the truncation time, thus the sampling weight function, to obtain more efficient estimation. In this paper, we propose to treat truncation and censoring as \"missing data mechanism\" and apply the missing information principle to develop a unified framework for analyzing left-truncated and right-censored data with unspecified or known truncation time distributions. Our framework is structured in a way that is easy to understand and enjoys a great flexibility for handling different types of models. Moreover, a new test for checking the independence between the underlying truncation time and survival time is derived along the same line. The proposed hypothesis testing procedure utilizes all observed data and hence can yield a much higher power than the conditional Kendall's tau test that only involves comparable pairs of observations under truncation. Simulation studies with practical sample sizes are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed method with its competitors.

  {"id":"sun:2013","abstract":"Frequent rise of interval-censored time-to-event data in randomized clinical trials (e.g., progression-free survival [PFS] in oncology) challenges statistical researchers in the pharmaceutical industry in various ways. These challenges exist in both trial design and data analysis. Conventional statistical methods treating intervals as fixed points, which are generally practiced by pharmaceutical industry, sometimes yield inferior or even flawed analysis results in extreme cases for interval-censored data. In this article, we examine the limitation of these standard methods under typical clinical trial settings and further review and compare several existing nonparametric likelihood-based methods for interval-censored data, methods that are more sophisticated but robust. Trial design issues involved with interval-censored data comprise another topic to be explored in this article. Unlike right-censored survival data, expected sample size or power for a trial with interval-censored data relies heavily on the parametric distribution of the baseline survival function as well as the frequency of assessments. There can be substantial power loss in trials with interval-censored data if the assessments are very infrequent. Such an additional dependency controverts many fundamental assumptions and principles in conventional survival trial designs, especially the group sequential design (e.g., the concept of information fraction). In this article, we discuss these fundamental changes and available tools to work around their impacts. Although progression-free survival is often used as a discussion point in the article, the general conclusions are equally applicable to other interval-censored time-to-event endpoints.","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoyun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Song","given":"Yang"}],"citation-key":"sun:2013","container-title":"Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics","container-title-short":"J Biopharm Stat","DOI":"10.1080/10543406.2013.813524","ISSN":"1520-5711","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"eng","page":"986-1003","PMID":"23957511","source":"PubMed","title":"A review of statistical issues with progression-free survival as an interval-censored time-to-event endpoint","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"sundraniComputingHazardRatios2021","abstract":"Purpose: The application of Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) models to survival data and the derivation of Hazard Ratio (HR) is well established. While nonlinear, tree-based Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed and applied to the survival analysis, no methodology exists for computing HRs associated with explanatory variables from such models. We describe a novel way to compute HRs from tree-based ML models using the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values, which is a locally accurate and consistent methodology to quantify explanatory variables' contribution to predictions. Methods: We used three sets of publicly available survival data consisting of patients with colon, breast or pan cancer and compared the performance of CoxPH to the state-of-art ML model, XGBoost. To compute the HR for explanatory variables from the XGBoost model, the SHAP values were exponentiated and the ratio of the means over the two subgroups calculated. The confidence interval was computed via bootstrapping the training data and generating the ML model 1000 times. Across the three data sets, we systematically compared HRs for all explanatory variables. Open-source libraries in Python and R were used in the analyses. Results: For the colon and breast cancer data sets, the performance of CoxPH and XGBoost were comparable and we showed good consistency in the computed HRs. In the pan-cancer dataset, we showed agreement in most variables but also an opposite finding in two of the explanatory variables between the CoxPH and XGBoost result. Subsequent Kaplan-Meier plots supported the finding of the XGBoost model. Conclusion: Enabling the derivation of HR from ML models can help to improve the identification of risk factors from complex survival datasets and enhance the prediction of clinical trial outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sundrani","given":"Sameer"},{"family":"Lu","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"sundraniComputingHazardRatios2021","container-title":"JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics","container-title-short":"JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics","DOI":"10.1200/CCI.20.00172","ISSN":"2473-4276","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"page":"364-378","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Computing the Hazard Ratios Associated with Explanatory Variables Using Machine Learning Models of Survival Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00637"},

  {"id":"sunTISCHComprehensiveWeb2021","abstract":"Cancer immunotherapy targeting co-inhibitory pathways by checkpoint blockade shows remarkable efficacy in a variety of cancer types. However, only a minority of patients respond to treatment due to the stochastic heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent advances in single-cell RNA-seq technologies enabled comprehensive characterization of the immune system heterogeneity in tumors but posed computational challenges on integrating and utilizing the massive published datasets to inform immunotherapy. Here, we present Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub (TISCH, http://tisch.comp-genomics.org), a large-scale curated database that integrates single-cell transcriptomic profiles of nearly 2 million cells from 76 high-quality tumor datasets across 27 cancer types.

A total of 4918 men and 5634 women were followed up prospectively for the first hip fracture between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2010.

Women represented more than 55% of the study sample over the years. Adjusted for age, the incidence of hip fracture decreased by 4.4% (95% CI, 6.8%-1.9%) per year from 1970 to 2010. Both period associations (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and birth cohort associations (<i>P</i> &lt; .001) were statistically significant. For example, in persons aged 85 to 89 years, the incidence of hip fracture was 759 per 100 000 person-years in the offspring group compared with 2018 per 100 000 person-years in the original cohort. The decrease in hip fracture incidence was coincident with a decrease in smoking and heavy drinking. Smoking decreased from 38% in the 1970s to 15% in the late 2000s, while heavy drinking decreased from 7.0% to 4.5%. The prevalence of other risk factors for hip fracture, such as underweight (body mass index &lt;18.5), obesity (body mass index &gt;30), and early menopause (age &lt;45 years) were stable over the study period. When persons who never smoked were evaluated, a change in the incidence of −3.2% (95% CI, −6.0% to −0.4%) per year was observed. The difference between the decrease of the entire population and nonsmokers of 1.5% per year was similar to the hazard ratio conferred by smoking (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.14-1.96).</p><h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3><p>In this study, individuals born more recently appeared to have a low risk for hip fracture. Reductions in smoking and heavy drinking were the risk factor changes coincident with the observed decrease in hip fracture. Attributing the decrease in hip fracture incidence up to 2010 solely to better treatment is not supported by these data, emphasizing the need to treat patients with osteoporosis while continuing to encourage public health interventions for smoking cessation and heavy drinking.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Swayambunathan","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Philip S."},{"family":"Hannan","given":"Marian T."},{"family":"Kiel","given":"Douglas P."},{"family":"Bhattacharyya","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"swayambunathanIncidenceHipFracture2020","container-title":"JAMA Internal Medicine","container-title-short":"JAMA Intern Med","DOI":"10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.2975","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,27]]},"language":"en","source":"jamanetwork.com","title":"Incidence of Hip Fracture Over 4 Decades in the Framingham Heart Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2768887"},

This has led naturally to the use of dynamic predictions that update each time a new longitudinal measurement is provided. In this paper, we show how such predictions can be utilised within a fuller decision modelling framework, in particular to allow planning of future interventions for patients under a 'watchful waiting' care pathway. Through the objective of maximising expected life-years, the predicted risks associated with not intervening (e.g. the occurrence of severe sequelae) are balanced against risks associated with the intervention (e.g. operative risks). Our example involves patients under surveillance in an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programme where a joint longitudinal and survival model is used to associate longitudinal measurements of aortic diameter with the risk of aneurysm rupture. We illustrate how the decision to intervene, which is currently based on a diameter measurement greater than a certain threshold, could be made more personalised and dynamic through the application of a decision modelling approach.","author":[{"family":"Sweeting","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"sweetingUsingPredictionsJoint2017","container-title":"Biometrical Journal.

Serial tissue and blood samples were collected.\nOutcome measurements and statistical analysis\nThe primary endpoints of pathological complete response (pCR) rate and dynamic changes to T-cell biomarkers were published previously. Secondary outcomes were 2-yr DFS and OS. A biomarker analysis correlated with relapse-free survival (RFS) was performed, which includes FOXP3, major histocompatibility complex class I, CD8/CD39, and sequential ctDNA measurements.\nResults and limitations\nThe median follow-up time was 25 mo (95% confidence interval [CI] 25–26). Ninety-five patients received at least one cycle of atezolizumab. Eight patients did not undergo cystectomy (only one due to disease progression). The pCR rate was 31% (27/88; 95% CI 21–41). Two-year DFS and OS were 68% (95% CI 58–76) and 77% (95% CI 68–85), respectively. Two-year DFS in patients achieving a pCR was 85% (95% CI 65–94). Baseline PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden did not correlate with RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.60 [95% CI 0.24–1.5], p = 0.26, and 0.72 [95% CI 0.31–1.7], p = 0.46, respectively). RFS correlated with high baseline stromal CD8+ (HR 0.25 [95% CI 0.09–0.68], p = 0.007) and high post-treatment fibroblast activation protein (HR 4.1 [95% CI 1.3–13], p = 0.01). Circulating tumor DNA positivity values at baseline, after neoadjuvant therapy, and after surgery were 63% (25/40), 47% (14/30), and 14% (five/36), respectively. The ctDNA status was highly prognostic at all time points. No relapses were observed in ctDNA-negative patients at baseline and after neoadjuvant therapy. The lack of randomization and exploratory nature of the biomarker analysis are limitations of this work.\nConclusions\nNeoadjuvant atezolizumab in MIBC is associated with clinical responses and high DFS. CD8+ expression and serial ctDNA levels correlated with outcomes, and may contribute to personalized therapy in the future.\nPatient summary\nWe showed that bladder cancer patients receiving immunotherapy followed by cystectomy have good long-term outcomes. Furthermore, we found that certain biological features can predict patients who might have particular benefit from this therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Szabados","given":"Bernadett"},{"family":"Kockx","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Assaf","given":"Zoe June"},{"family":"Dam","given":"Pieter-Jan","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Rodriguez-Vida","given":"Alejo"},{"family":"Duran","given":"Ignacio"},{"family":"Crabb","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Van Der Heijden","given":"Michiel S."},{"family":"Pous","given":"Albert Font"},{"family":"Gravis","given":"Gwenaelle"},{"family":"Herranz","given":"Urbano Anido"},{"family":"Protheroe","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Ravaud","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Maillet","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Mendez","given":"Maria Jose"},{"family":"Suarez","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Linch","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Prendergast","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Tyson","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Stanoeva","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Daelemans","given":"Sofie"},{"family":"Rombouts","given":"Miche"},{"family":"Mariathasan","given":"Sanjeev"},{"family":"Tea","given":"Joy S."},{"family":"Mousa","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Shruti"},{"family":"Aleshin","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Banchereau","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Castellano","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Powles","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"szabados_2022","container-title":"European Urology","container-title-short":"European Urology","DOI":"10.1016/j.eururo.2022.04.013","ISSN":"0302-2838","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,1]]},"page":"212-222","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Final Results of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab in Cisplatin-ineligible Patients with Muscle-invasive Urothelial Cancer of the Bladder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0302283822022199","volume":"82"},

  {"id":"Szymczak2016","abstract":"Machine learning methods and in particular random forests (RFs) are a promising alternative to standard single SNP analyses in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). RFs provide variable importance measures (VIMs) to rank SNPs according to their predictive power. However, in contrast to the established genome-wide significance threshold, no clear criteria exist to determine how many SNPs should be selected for downstream analyses. We propose a new variable selection approach, recurrent relative variable importance measure (r2VIM). Importance values are calculated relative to an observed minimal importance score for several runs of RF and only SNPs with large relative VIMs in all of the runs are selected as important. Evaluations on simulated GWAS data show that the new method controls the number of false-positives under the null hypothesis.

  {"id":"tabibNonparametricIndividualTreatment2020","abstract":"Personalized medicine often relies on accurate estimation of a treatment effect for specific subjects. This estimation can be based on the subject’s baseline covariates but additional complications arise for a time-to-event response subject to censoring. In this paper, the treatment effect is measured as the difference between the mean survival time of a treated subject and the mean survival time of a control subject. We propose a new random forest method for estimating the individual treatment effect with survival data. The random forest is formed by individual trees built with a splitting rule specifically designed to partition the data according to the individual treatment effect. For a new subject, the forest provides a set of similar subjects from the training dataset that can be used to compute an estimation of the individual treatment effect with any adequate method.The merits of the proposed method are investigated with a simulation study where it is compared to numerous competitors, including recent state-of-the-art methods. The results indicate that the proposed method has a very good and stable performance to estimate the individual treatment effects. Two examples of application with a colon cancer data and breast cancer data show that the proposed method can detect a treatment effect in a sub-population even when the overall effect is small or nonexistent.The authors are working on an R package implementing the proposed method and it will be available soon.

  {"id":"taherisoodejaniBayesianStatisticsClassical2021","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the world and 17 million people die from cardiovascular diseases around the world each year, so finding factors that affect the survival of these patients is of particular importance. Therefore, finding the best model to analyze patient survival can help to find more accurate results.\nMETHODS: There are different methods to survival analysis that assess one or more risk factors; the classic Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, parametric survival models, and newer models such as Bayesian survival. Cox regression is most common and is generally used for time-dependent data, and the main difference between cox regression and Bayesian models is that the prior distribution in Bayesian models can affect the values of the parameters. Some survival analysis models have certain conditions that need to be considered before analyzing the data. In this paper, we use a dataset from Kaggle and discuss these conditions. This dataset contains medical records of 299 patients with heart failure collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad (Punjab, Pakistan) from April to December 2015.\nRESULTS: This paper discusses that if the effective sample size is not sufficient, Bayesian survival models can be used to achieve more accurate results because this model is not affected by the sample size. The results of both methods are shown on a sample of cardiac data and based on the results of Bayesian Cox regression model, it was observed that Age, Anemia, Ejection fraction, High blood pressure and Serum creatinine were effective on patient survival.\nCONCLUSION: The Bayesian models are much more accurate to determine survival and determine risk factors when dealing with data on rare diseases or diseases with low mortality, including heart patients whose survival probability is higher than that of cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Taheri Soodejani","given":"Moslem"},{"family":"Tabatabaei","given":"Seyyed Mohammad"},{"family":"Mahmoudimanesh","given":"Marzieh"}],"citation-key":"taherisoodejaniBayesianStatisticsClassical2021","container-title":"American Journal of Cardiovascular Disease","container-title-short":"Am J Cardiovasc Dis","ISSN":"2160-200X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"484-488","PMCID":"PMC8449193","PMID":"34548947","source":"PubMed","title":"Bayesian statistics versus classical statistics in survival analysis: an applicable example","title-short":"Bayesian statistics versus classical statistics in survival analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

Cell-type-specific effects of a trait, such as disease, on the omics expression are of interest but difficult or costly to measure experimentally. By measuring omics data for the bulk tissue, cell type composition of a sample can be inferred statistically. Subsequently, cell-type-specific effects are estimated by linear regression that includes terms representing the interaction between the cell type proportions and the trait. This approach involves two issues, scaling and multicollinearity.\n              \n                Results\n                First, although cell composition is analyzed in linear scale, differential methylation/expression is analyzed suitably in the logit/log scale. To simultaneously analyze two scales, we applied nonlinear regression. Second, we show that the interaction terms are highly collinear, which is obstructive to ordinary regression. To cope with the multicollinearity, we applied ridge regularization. In simulated data, nonlinear ridge regression attained well-balanced sensitivity, specificity and precision. Marginal model attained the lowest precision and highest sensitivity and was the only algorithm to detect weak signal in real data.\n              \n                Conclusion\n                Nonlinear ridge regression performed cell-type-specific association test on bulk omics data with well-balanced performance.

We present a model class that incorporates general normally distributed random effects into linear transformation models. We discuss extensions to model between-study heterogeneity in baseline risks and covariate effects and also relax the assumption of proportional hazards. Within the proposed framework, data with arbitrary random censoring patterns can be handled. The accompanying $\\textsf{R}$ package tramME utilizes the Laplace approximation and automatic differentiation to perform efficient maximum likelihood estimation and inference in mixed-effects transformation models. We compare several variants of our model to predict the survival of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using a large data set of prognostic studies.

This information might provide clues to their aetiology. We examined the spatial distribution of syndesmophytes in the thoracolumbar spine in patients with AS using CT. We performed lumbar spine CT scans in 50 patients and used a validated computer algorithm to measure syndesmophyte heights in six intervertebral disc spaces. We measured heights every five radial degrees around the rim of each superior and inferior vertebral endplate. Syndesmophytes were observed in 208 of 296 intervertebral disc spaces. Both ascending and descending syndesmophytes were non-randomly distributed along the vertebral rim (p¡0.0001 for deviation from uniform distribution). Syndesmophytes occurred most often at the posterolateral vertebral rim, and least commonly at the posterior rim and anterior rim. In disc spaces with only small isolated syndesmophytes, these were also most likely to occur at the posterolateral rim. Syndesmophyte distribution varied with the vertebral level. Localisation at the posterolateral rim was most pronounced at T10-T11, T12-T12 and T12-L1, while L2-L3 and L3-L4 exhibited little localisation. Syndesmophytes are not randomly distributed around the vertebral rim, as might be expected if they develop solely in response to inflammation. Rather, they preferentially occur, and likely develop first, at the posterolateral rim. Studying factors that can lead to this pattern may help elucidate how syndesmophytes develop.","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Sovira"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Flynn","given":"John A"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M"}],"citation-key":"Tan2016","container-title":"Annals of Rheumatic Disease","DOI":"10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208802","ISSN":"1468-2060","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"page":"1951–1957","PMID":"26797721","title":"Spatial distribution of syndesmophytes along the vertebral rim in ankylosing spondylitis: preferential involvement of the posterolateral rim.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208802","volume":"75"},

We investigated if syndesmophytes in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) occurred less often at the vertebral rim near the aorta. We performed thoracolumbar CT scans in 60 subjects in this cross-sectional study. The mid-thoracic spine was also scanned in 22 subjects. We divided the rim of each intervertebral disc space (IDS) into 72 angular sectors, each of 5 <sup>∘</sup>. We computed syndesmophyte height in each sector, and the distance from the sector to the aorta. We evaluated if syndesmophyte size or frequency in a sector was associated with its distance from the aorta. In the 180 <sup>∘</sup> region of the vertebral rim centered on the sector closest to the aorta, syndesmophyte height and/or frequency varied with the distance of the sector to the aorta, with the lowest frequency and smallest mean syndesmophyte height at the sector along the rim nearest the aorta. Additionally, syndesmophytes were less common in subjects and at IDSs where the aorta was anatomically closer to the vertebra. No syndesmophytes were present in the sector closest to the aorta in subjects whose aorta-vertebral distance was less than 2 mm, but syndesmophytes were progressively more common among subjects whose aortas lay further from the rim. Syndesmophytes occurred less commonly and were smaller at the thoracolumbar vertebral rim near the aorta.

From the lenders' perspective, maximizing their return on investment is an ultimate goal during their decision-making procedure. In this paper, we explore and address a fundamental problem underlying such a goal: how to represent the two competing risks, charge-off and prepayment, in funded loans. We propose to model both potential risks simultaneously, which remains largely unexplored until now. We first develop a hierarchical grading framework to integrate two risks of loans both qualitatively and quantitatively. Afterward, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning approach to solve this problem by breaking it down into multiple binary classification subproblems that are amenable to both feature representation and risks learning. Particularly, we leverage deep neural networks to jointly solve these subtasks, which leads to the in-depth exploration of the interaction involved in these tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize competing risks for loans in P2P lending via deep neural networks. The comprehensive experiments on real-world loan data show that our methodology is able to achieve an appealing investment performance by modeling the competition within and between risks explicitly and properly. The feature analysis based on saliency maps provides useful insights into payment dynamics of loans for potential investors intuitively.","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Xiurui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Zhenyu"}],"citation-key":"tanDeepLearningApproach2019","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","DOI":"10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2870573","ISSN":"2162-2388","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"page":"1565-1574","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Deep Learning Approach to Competing Risks Representation in Peer-to-Peer Lending","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

In the current COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a lack of reliable clinical tools to assist clinicians to perform accurate triage. Host response biomarkers have recently shown promise in risk stratification of disease progression; however, the role of these biomarkers in predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Here, we present a protocol outlining a prospective validation study to evaluate the biomarkers’ performance in predicting clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19.\nMethods and analysis This prospective validation study assesses patients infected with COVID-19, in whom blood samples are prospectively collected. Recruited patients include a range of infection severity from asymptomatic to critically ill patients, recruited from the community, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and hospitals. Study samples consist of peripheral blood samples collected into RNA-preserving (PAXgene/Tempus) tubes on patient presentation or immediately on study enrolment. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be performed on total RNA extracted from collected blood samples using primers specific to host response gene expression biomarkers that have been previously identified in studies of respiratory viral infections. The RT-PCR data will be analysed to assess the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers in predicting COVID-19-related outcomes, such as viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or bacterial pneumonia. Biomarker performance will be evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.\nEthics and dissemination This research protocol aims to study the host response gene expression biomarkers in severe respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential (COVID-19). It has been approved by the local ethics committee with approval number 2020/ETH00886. The results of this project will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Shojaei","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ya"},{"family":"Nalos","given":"Marek"},{"family":"Mclean","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Afrasiabi","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Kwan","given":"Tim N."},{"family":"Kuan","given":"Win Sen"},{"family":"Zerbib","given":"Yoann"},{"family":"Herwanto","given":"Velma"},{"family":"Gunawan","given":"Gunawan"},{"family":"Bedognetti","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Zoppoli","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Ballestrero","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Rinchai","given":"Darawan"},{"family":"Cremonesi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Bedognetti","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Matejovic","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Karvunidis","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Macdonald","given":"Stephen P.

  {"id":"tanProstateCancerGenomics2018","abstract":"Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States. Among African American (AA) men, CaP is the most prevalent malignancy, with disproportionately higher incidence and mortality rates. Even after discounting the influence of socioeconomic factors, the effect of molecular and genetic factors on racial disparity of CaP is evident. Earlier studies on the molecular basis for CaP disparity have focused on the influence of heritable mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Most CaP susceptibility alleles identified based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were common, low-penetrance variants. Germline CaP-associated mutations that are highly penetrant, such as those found in HOXB13 and BRCA2, are usually rare. More recently, genomic studies enabled by Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS) technologies have focused on the identification of somatic mutations that contribute to CaP tumorigenesis. These studies confirmed the high prevalence of ERG gene fusions and PTEN deletions among Caucasian Americans and identified novel somatic alterations in SPOP and FOXA1 genes in early stages of CaP. Individuals with African ancestry and other minorities are often underrepresented in these large-scale genomic studies, which are performed primarily using tumors from men of European ancestry. The insufficient number of specimens from AA men and other minority populations, together with the heterogeneity in the molecular etiology of CaP across populations, challenge the generalizability of findings from these projects. Efforts to close this gap by sequencing larger numbers of tumor specimens from more diverse populations, although still at an early stage, have discovered distinct genomic alterations. These research findings can have a direct impact on the diagnosis of CaP, the stratification of patients for treatment, and can help to address the disparity in incidence and mortality of CaP. This review examines the progress of understanding in CaP genetics and genomics and highlight the need to increase the representation from minority populations.","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Shyh-Han"},{"family":"Petrovics","given":"Gyorgy"},{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Shiv"}],"citation-key":"tanProstateCancerGenomics2018","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"Int J Mol Sci","DOI":"10.3390/ijms19041255","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,22]]},"language":"eng","PMCID":"PMC5979433","PMID":"29690565","source":"PubMed","title":"Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities","title-short":"Prostate Cancer Genomics","type":"article-journal","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"tapakCompetingRisksData2015","abstract":"Analysis of microarray data is associated with the methodological problems of high dimension and small sample size. Various methods have been used for variable selection in high-dimension and small sample size cases with a single survival endpoint. However, little effort has been directed toward addressing competing risks where there is more than one failure risks. This study compared three typical variable selection techniques including Lasso, elastic net, and likelihood-based boosting for high-dimensional time-to-event data with competing risks. The performance of these methods was evaluated via a simulation study by analyzing a real dataset related to bladder cancer patients using time-dependent receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and bootstrap .632+ prediction error curves. The elastic net penalization method was shown to outperform Lasso and boosting. Based on the elastic net, 33 genes out of 1381 genes related to bladder cancer were selected. By fitting to the Fine and Gray model, eight genes were highly significant (P<0.001). Among them, expression of RTN4, SON, IGF1R, SNRPE, PTGR1, PLEK, and ETFDH was associated with a decrease in survival time, whereas SMARCAD1 expression was associated with an increase in survival time. This study indicates that the elastic net has a higher capacity than the Lasso and boosting for the prediction of survival time in bladder cancer patients. Moreover, genes selected by all methods improved the predictive power of the model based on only clinical variables, indicating the value of information contained in the microarray features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tapak","given":"Leili"},{"family":"Saidijam","given":"Massoud"},{"family":"Sadeghifar","given":"Majid"},{"family":"Poorolajal","given":"Jalal"},{"family":"Mahjub","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"tapakCompetingRisksData2015","container-title":"Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.gpb.2015.04.001","ISSN":"1672-0229","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"169-176","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Competing Risks Data Analysis with High-dimensional Covariates: An Application in Bladder Cancer","title-short":"Competing Risks Data Analysis with High-dimensional Covariates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022915000406","volume":"13"},

The success of a multi-omic data analysis strategy depends largely on the adoption of adequate experimental designs, and on the quality of the measurements provided by the different omic platforms. However, the field lacks a comparative description of performance parameters across omic technologies and a formulation for experimental design in multi-omic data scenarios. Here, we propose a set of harmonized Figures of Merit (FoM) as quality descriptors applicable to different omic data types. Employing this information, we formulate the MultiPower method to estimate and assess the optimal sample size in a multi-omics experiment. MultiPower supports different experimental settings, data types and sample sizes, and includes graphical for experimental design decision-making. MultiPower is complemented with MultiML, an algorithm to estimate sample size for machine learning classification problems based on multi-omic data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarazona","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Balzano-Nogueira","given":"Leandro"},{"family":"Gómez-Cabrero","given":"David"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Imhof","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Hankemeier","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Tegnér","given":"Jesper"},{"family":"Westerhuis","given":"Johan A."},{"family":"Conesa","given":"Ana"}],"citation-key":"tarazona:2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-16937-8","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,18]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s)","page":"3092","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Harmonization of quality metrics and power calculation in multi-omic studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16937-8","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"tarkhanSurvivalPredictionUsing","abstract":"In many biomedical applications, outcome is measured as a “time-to-event” (e.g., time-todisease progression or death). Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model has been widely used to assess the association between baseline characteristics of a patient and this outcome. Meanwhile, in therapeutic areas such as Oncology, clinical imaging (e.g. computerized tomography (CT) scan) is widely used for detection, diagnosis of disease, monitoring of progression and treatment eﬀect. We are interested in using such images with neural network to build predictive models with survival data. However, the standard methodologies cannot be applied to imaging data with time-to-event outcome due to challenges such as memory constraint. In this work, we develop a simple methodology to engage images with survival data. Our proposed methodology is a modiﬁed version of CoxPH model that is amenable to SGD and allows us to overcome the existing challenges. We present the neural network architecture for the survival prediction using images. Our architecture can leverage new advances in network topology.","author":[{"family":"Tarkhan","given":"Aliasghar"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Kien"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Jian"}],"citation-key":"tarkhanSurvivalPredictionUsing","language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Survival Prediction Using Deep Learning","type":"article-journal"},

In particular, models involving biomarkers require careful validation for two reasons: issues with overfitting when complex models involve a large number of biomarkers, and interlaboratory variation in assays used to measure biomarkers. In this article, we distinguish between internal and external statistical validation. Internal validation, involving training-testing splits of the available data or cross-validation, is a necessary component of the model building process and can provide valid assessments of model performance. External validation consists of assessing model performance on one or more data sets collected by different investigators from different institutions. External validation is a more rigorous procedure necessary for evaluating whether the predictive model will generalize to populations other than the one on which it was developed. We stress the need for an external data set to be truly external, that is, to play no role in model development and ideally be completely unavailable to the researchers building the model. In addition to reviewing different types of validation, we describe different types and features of predictive models and strategies for model building, as well as measures appropriate for assessing their performance in the context of validation. No single measure can characterize the different components of the prediction, and the use of multiple summary measures is recommended.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Jeremy M.G."},{"family":"Ankerst","given":"Donna P."},{"family":"Andridge","given":"Rebecca R."}],"citation-key":"taylorValidationBiomarkerBasedRisk2008","container-title":"Clinical Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Clinical Cancer Research","DOI":"10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4534","ISSN":"1078-0432","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,30]]},"page":"5977-5983","source":"Silverchair","title":"Validation of Biomarker-Based Risk Prediction Models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4534","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"tec:2023","abstract":"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computational approach to reward-driven learning in sequential decision problems. It implements the discovery of optimal actions by learning from an agent interacting with an environment rather than from supervised data. We contrast and compare RL with traditional sequential design, focusing on simulation-based Bayesian sequential design (BSD). Recently, there has been an increasing interest in RL techniques for healthcare applications. We introduce two related applications as motivating examples. In both applications, the sequential nature of the decisions is restricted to sequential stopping. Rather than a comprehensive survey, the focus of the discussion is on solutions using standard tools for these two relatively simple sequential stopping problems. Both problems are inspired by adaptive clinical trial design. We use examples to explain the terminology and mathematical background that underlie each framework and map one to the other. The implementations and results illustrate the many similarities between RL and BSD. The results motivate the discussion of the potential strengths and limitations of each approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tec","given":"Mauricio"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Yunshan"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"tec:2023","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2022.2129787","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"page":"223-233","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"A Comparative Tutorial of Bayesian Sequential Design and Reinforcement Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2022.2129787","volume":"77"},

METHODS: We used data on US adults with arthritis, ages ¿/=40 years, participating in the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Suicidal ideation was assessed by item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and comorbid conditions were examined as potential correlates. Depression was measured by the PHQ-8 score (range 1-24). We used random forests to identify subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation. To determine if any correlates were unique to arthritis, we compared results to those for persons with diabetes mellitus and cancer. RESULTS: The prevalence +/- SEM of suicidal ideation was 5.6% +/- 0.8% among persons with arthritis and 2.4% +/- 0.4% among those without. The most important correlates for suicidal ideation in adults with arthritis were depression, anxiety, duration of arthritis, age, income:poverty ratio, number of close friends, pain, alcohol, excessive daytime sleepiness, and comorbidities. Eleven of the 16 most important contributors for suicidal ideation among adults with arthritis were also important for people with diabetes mellitus and cancer. Among persons with arthritis, subgroups at highest risk for suicidal ideation were those with a PHQ-8 score between 18 and 24 and less than 4.5 years of arthritis (96.5%), and those with a PHQ-8 score between 7 and 17, ¿/=1.24 days of binges/month, and either an income of ¿/=45,000/year(85.4%)oranincomeof<45,000/year and ¿3 comorbidities (70.8%).

METHODS: We analyzed hospitalizations for pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, urinary tract infections, skin infections, and opportunistic infections among adults in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We compared rates of hospitalization yearly among patients with SLE and the general population. We also computed odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: In 1996, the estimated number of hospitalizations for pneumonia in patients with SLE was 4,382, followed by sepsis (2,305), skin infections (1,422), urinary tract infections (643), and opportunistic infections (370). Rates were much higher in patients with SLE than in those without SLE, with age-adjusted relative risks ranging from 5.7 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 5.5-6.0) for pneumonia to 9.8 (95% CI 9.1-10.7) for urinary tract infection in 1996. Risks increased over time, so that by 2011, all relative risks exceeded 12.0. Overall risk of in-hospital mortality was higher in SLE only for opportunistic infections (adjusted OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.12-2.07]). However, in pneumonia and sepsis, mortality risks were higher in SLE among those who required mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization rates for serious infections in SLE increased substantially between 1996 and 2011, reaching over 12 times higher than in patients without SLE in 2011. Reasons for this acceleration are unclear. In-hospital mortality was higher among patients with SLE and opportunistic infections and those with pneumonia or sepsis who required mechanical ventilation.","author":[{"family":"Tektonidou","given":"Maria G"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhong"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M"}],"citation-key":"Tektonidou2015","container-title":"Arthritis Care & Research","event-place":"United States","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8]]},"page":"1078-85","PMID":"25732901","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Burden of serious infections in adults with systemic lupus erythematosus: a national population-based study, 1996-2011.","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},

We conducted this systematic review to examine changes in ESRD among adults with lupus nephritis from 1971 to 2015 and to estimate risks of ESRD among contemporary patients. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for cohort studies and clinical trials on ESRD in adults with lupus nephritis. We analyzed studies from developed and developing countries separately. The outcome was probability of ESRD at 5, 10, and 15 years of lupus nephritis. We included 187 articles that reported on 18,309 patients. In developed countries, the 5-year risk of ESRD decreased from 16% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 14-17%) in 1970-1979 to 11% (95% CI 10-12%) in the mid-1990s and then plateaued. ESRD risks at 10 years and 15 years showed steeper declines in the 1970s and 1980s but also plateaued in 1993-1997, with a notable increase in the late 2000s. The decrease in risk after 1980 coincided with increased use of cyclophosphamide. The 15-year ESRD risk was higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Patients with class IV lupus nephritis had the greatest risk of ESRD, with a 15-year risk of 44% during the 2000s. Risks of ESRD in lupus nephritis improved between the 1970s and the mid-1990s and then plateaued, with an increase in the late 2000s.

We used Bayesian methods to derive pooled survival estimates separately for adult and pediatric patients, as well as for studies from high income countries and low/middle income countries. We pooled contemporaneous studies to obtain trends in survival over time. We also examined trends in major causes of death. Results: We identified 125 studies of adult patients and 51 studies of pediatric patients. Among adults, survival improved gradually from the 1950's to the mid-1990's in both high income and low/middle income countries, after which survival plateaued. In 2008-2016, the 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year pooled survival estimates in adults from high income countries were 0.95, 0.89, and 0.82, and in low/middle income countries were 0.92, 0.85, and 0.79 respectively. Among children, in 2008-2016, the 5-year and 10-year pooled survival estimates from high income countries were 0.99 and 0.97, while in low/middle income countries were 0.85 and 0.79, respectively. The proportion of deaths due to SLE decreased over time in studies of adults and among children from high income countries. Conclusions: After a period of major improvement, survival in SLE has plateaued since the mid-1990's. In high income countries, 5-year survival exceeds 0.95 in both adults and children.

However, the computational complexity of such frailty models has limited their general use. Although fitting frailty models has traditionally been difficult, standard algorithms for fitting Cox semiparametric and parametric regression models can be readily extended to include penalized regression. We demonstrate that solutions for gamma shared frailty models can be obtained exactly via penalized estimation. Similarly, Gaussian frailty models are closely linked to penalized models. Fitting frailty models with penalized likelihoods can be made quite efficient by taking advantage of computational methods available for penalized models.

This uncertainty can be analyzed with Bayesian statistics, however, the sampling algorithms that are frequently used for calculating Bayesian statistical estimates are computationally demanding, and each algorithm has unique advantages and disadvantages. It is typically unclear, before starting an analysis, which algorithm will perform well on a given computational model.ResultsWe present BCM, a toolkit for the Bayesian analysis of Computational Models using samplers. It provides efficient, multithreaded implementations of eleven algorithms for sampling from posterior probability distributions and for calculating marginal likelihoods. BCM includes tools to simplify the process of model specification and scripts for visualizing the results. The flexible architecture allows it to be used on diverse types of biological computational models. In an example inference task using a model of the cell cycle based on ordinary differential equations, BCM is significantly more efficient than existing software packages, allowing more challenging inference problems to be solved.ConclusionsBCM represents an efficient one-stop-shop for computational modelers wishing to use sampler-based Bayesian statistics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Thijssen","given":"Bram"},{"family":"Dijkstra","given":"Tjeerd M.

The growing number of targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic options available have improved response rates and survival for a subset of patients, however determining which patients will experience clinical benefit from these therapies in order to avoid potential toxicities and reduce healthcare costs remains a clinical challenge. Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is shed by tumor cells into systemic circulation and is already an integral part of routine clinical practice for the non-invasive tumor genotyping in advanced non-small cell lung cancer as well as other malignancies. The short half-life of ctDNA offers a unique opportunity to utilize early on-treatment changes in ctDNA for real-time assessment of therapeutic response and outcome, termed molecular response. Here, we provide a summary and review of the use of molecular response for the prediction of outcomes in patients with advanced cancer, including the current state of science, its application in clinic, and next steps for the development of this predictive tool.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Scholes","given":"Dylan G."},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Erica L."},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Charu"}],"citation-key":"thompson:2023","container-title":"British Journal of Cancer","container-title-short":"Br J Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/s41416-023-02445-1","ISSN":"1532-1827","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","page":"1893-1902","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Molecular response assessment using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in advanced solid tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-023-02445-1","volume":"129"},

Here we address the problem of quantifying the population diversity in experiments where high throughput DNA sequencing is used to distinguish a large number of cell subpopulations. Our model assumes a list of clonal species and their observed frequencies in each of several replicate sequencing libraries. Though the underlying distribution of frequencies cannot be estimated well from data coming from only a small fraction of the total cell population, one can estimate well the population-level clonality, defined as the sum of squared underlying fractions of the respective clones, the complement of the Gini–Simpson index. Specifically, we proposed to adaptively combine multiple unbiased estimators of clonality derived from pairs of replicates to construct a single estimator without relying on the commonly used but restrictive multinomial assumption. The new estimator performs particularly well for replicates of unequal size. We further illustrate the proposed methods with extensive simulations and a small real data example.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Fire","given":"Andrew Z."},{"family":"Boyd","given":"Scott D."},{"family":"Olshen","given":"Richard A."}],"citation-key":"tianClonalityPointEstimation2019","container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/18-AOAS1197","ISSN":"1932-6157, 1941-7330","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3]]},"page":"113-131","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Clonality: Point estimation","title-short":"Clonality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-13/issue-1/Clonality-Point-estimation/10.1214/18-AOAS1197.full","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Toll2010","abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Single-agent gemcitabine remains the standard treatment of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recently discovered histone methyltransferase termed enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) was found to be overexpressed in a variety of carcinomas including pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Silencing of E-cadherin was proposed as a mechanism by which enhancer of zeste homologue 2 mediates tumor aggressiveness, and enhancer of zeste homologue 2 depletion has been found to sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. In this study, we correlated enhancer of zeste homologue 2 with E-cadherin expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and evaluated response to gemcitabine in relation to enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression in tumor cells. Fifty-four pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 13 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and 6 chronic pancreatitis cases were stained with antibodies against enhancer of zeste homologue 2 and E-cadherin. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 staining was scored from 1 to 4+ and classified as either low (1-2+ in ¡25% of tumor nuclei) or high (3-4+ in ¿25% of tumor nuclei). E-cadherin expression was scored on membrane positivity as follows: 0 (0%-10%), 1 (10%-25%), 2 (25%-75%), and 3 (¿75%). High enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression in pancreatic adenocarcinoma was significantly associated with decreased E-cadherin expression and more aggressive disease. There was significantly longer survival in gemcitabine-treated patients with low versus high enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression. High enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression was detected in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms with moderate to severe dysplasia, but not in chronic pancreatitis. Our study suggests that E-cadherin down-regulation may lead to enhancer of zeste homologue 2-mediated invasion and metastasis.","author":[{"family":"Toll","given":"Adam D"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Potoczek","given":"Magdalena"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Charles J"},{"family":"Kleer","given":"Celina G"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jonathan R"},{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"}],"citation-key":"Toll2010","container-title":"Human Pathology","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"0046-8177 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"page":"1205-9","PMID":"20573371","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Implications of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

Motivated by the world's largest AS program, Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS), we present personalized schedules for biopsies to counter these problems. Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, our methods combine information from historical prostate-specific antigen levels and repeat biopsy results of a patient, to schedule the next biopsy. We also present methods to compare personalized schedules with existing biopsy schedules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Tomer","given":"Anirudh"},{"family":"Nieboer","given":"Daan"},{"family":"Roobol","given":"Monique J."},{"family":"Steyerberg","given":"Ewout W."},{"family":"Rizopoulos","given":"Dimitris"}],"citation-key":"tomerPersonalizedSchedulesSurveillance2019","container-title":"Biometrics","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12940","ISSN":"1541-0420","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"153-162","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Personalized schedules for surveillance of low-risk prostate cancer patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.12940","volume":"75"},

Next-generation sequencing has identified the genes most mutated in bladder cancer. This wealth of information allowed the definition of driver mutations, and identification of actionable therapeutic targets, as well as a clearer picture of patient prognosis and therapeutic direction. In a similar vein, our understanding of the cellular aspects of bladder cancer has grown. The identification of the cellular geography and the populations of different cell types and quantifications of normal and abnormal cell types in tumours provide a better prediction of therapeutic response. Non-invasive methods of diagnosis, including liquid biopsies, have seen major advances as well. These methods will likely find considerable utility in assessing minimal residual disease following treatment and for early-stage diagnosis. A significant therapeutic impact on patients with bladder cancer is found in the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapeutics. These therapeutics have been shown to cure some patients with bladder cancer and significantly decrease adverse events.

For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than PyMC3.

To compare the utility of this Bayesian basket (BB) design with that of a balanced randomized, biomarker agnostic (BA) design and a traditional basket (TB) design that includes only biomarker-positive patients, we iteratively simulated hypothetical multiarm clinical trials under various scenarios.\n\nResults\nBB was more efficient than BA while generating more information on the predictive capacity of putative biomarkers than both BA and TB. For simulations of hypothetical multiarm trials of experimental therapies and associated biomarkers of varying incident frequency, BB increased power over BA in cases when the biomarker was predictive and when the experimental therapeutic worked in all patients in a variety of scenarios. BB also generated more information about the predictive capacity of biomarkers than BA and categorically relative to TB, which generates no new biomarker information.\n\nConclusion\nThe BB design offers an efficient way to generate information on both experimental therapeutics and the predictive capacity of putative biomarkers.

  {"id":"tudursmithComparisonMethodsFixed2007","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Alternative methods for individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes have been established and utilized in practice. The most common approach is a stratified log-rank analysis. The IPD approach is considered to be the gold standard approach for meta-analysis and is becoming increasingly more popular but the performance of different methods has not been studied previously.\nPURPOSE: To compare commonly used methods for fixed effects meta-analysis of individual patient time-to-event data.\nMETHODS: The stratified log-rank analysis, an inverse variance weighted average of Cox model estimates, and the stratified Cox regression model are compared. First, a theoretical comparison of approaches is undertaken. Second, the bias and coverage are assessed for the pooled hazard ratio using simulated data under commonly encountered meta-analysis conditions. Finally, a comparison is presented using empirical data from four separate systematic reviews of anti-epileptic drug trials where IPD are available for two time-to-event outcomes.\nRESULTS: For hazard ratio close to 1 with minimal heterogeneity between trials, theoretical results suggest similar results should be expected from all the three methods. Results for empirical and simulated data are in keeping with the theoretical results and show all the three methods perform well under these conditions. When there is no heterogeneity and the proportional hazards assumption holds, the stratified Cox model and inverse variance weighted average produce similar estimates of the pooled treatment effect and are to be preferred to the stratified log-rank analysis when the underlying treatment effect is large. Coverage values diminish for all the three methods and are below 95% for low or moderate heterogeneity. The low coverage values highlight the need for models that appropriately account for or explore the between trial variation.\nLIMITATIONS: Until larger simulations can be undertaken, conclusions based on the simulated and empirical data should only be applied to small meta-analyses of four or five trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: These investigations suggest that under normal conditions all three methods provide similar results. For moderate heterogeneity coverage for all the three fixed effects models depreciates.","author":[{"family":"Tudur Smith","given":"Catrin"},{"family":"Williamson","given":"Paula Ruth"}],"citation-key":"tudursmithComparisonMethodsFixed2007","container-title":"Clinical Trials (London, England)","container-title-short":"Clin Trials","DOI":"10.1177/1740774507085276","ISSN":"1740-7745","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"eng","page":"621-630","PMID":"18042571","source":"PubMed","title":"A comparison of methods for fixed effects meta-analysis of individual patient data with time to event outcomes","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"turnerTwoProblemsVariational","abstract":"Variational methods are a key component of the approximate inference and learning toolbox. These methods ﬁll an important middle ground, retaining distributional information about uncertainty in latent variables, unlike maximum a posteriori methods (MAP), and yet requiring fewer computational resources than Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. In particular the variational Expectation Maximisation (vEM) and variational Bayes algorithms, both involving variational optimisation of a free energy, are widely used in time-series modelling. Here, we investigate the success of vEM in simple probabilistic time-series models. First we consider the inference step of vEM, and show that a consequence of the wellknown compactness property is a failure to propagate uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of the retained distributional information. In particular, the uncertainty may appear to be smallest precisely when the approximation is poorest. Second, we consider parameter learning and analytically reveal systematic biases in the parameters found by vEM. Surprisingly, simpler variational approximations (such a mean-ﬁeld) can lead to less bias than more complicated structured approximations.","author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Richard E"},{"family":"Berkes","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Sahani","given":"Maneesh"}],"citation-key":"turnerTwoProblemsVariational","language":"en","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"Two problems with variational expectation maximisation for time-series models","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"tusher:2001","abstract":"Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify changes in expression between different biological states. Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84% by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Tusher","given":"Virginia Goss"},{"family":"Tibshirani","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Gilbert"}],"citation-key":"tusher:2001","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.091062498","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",4,24]]},"page":"5116-5121","publisher":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","source":"pnas.org (Atypon)","title":"Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.091062498","volume":"98"},

This methodology has generated a myriad of robust associations for a range of traits and diseases, and the number of associated variants is expected to grow steadily as GWAS sample sizes increase. GWAS results have a range of applications, such as gaining insight into a phenotype’s underlying biology, estimating its heritability, calculating genetic correlations, making clinical risk predictions, informing drug development programmes and inferring potential causal relationships between risk factors and health outcomes.

We present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep learning method for long-term pan-cancer survival prediction. MultiSurv uses dedicated submodels to establish feature representations of clinical, imaging, and different high-dimensional omics data modalities. A data fusion layer aggregates the multimodal representations, and a prediction submodel generates conditional survival probabilities for follow-up time intervals spanning several decades. MultiSurv is the first non-linear and non-proportional survival prediction method that leverages multimodal data. In addition, MultiSurv can handle missing data, including single values and complete data modalities. MultiSurv was applied to data from 33 different cancer types and yields accurate pan-cancer patient survival curves. A quantitative comparison with previous methods showed that Multisurv achieves the best results according to different time-dependent metrics.

  {"id":"vandeschoot_2015","abstract":"Background\nThe analysis of small data sets in longitudinal studies can lead to power issues and often suffers from biased parameter values. These issues can be solved by using Bayesian estimation in conjunction with informative prior distributions. By means of a simulation study and an empirical example concerning posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors, we demonstrate the advantages and potential pitfalls of using Bayesian estimation.\n\nMethods\nFirst, we show how to specify prior distributions and by means of a sensitivity analysis we demonstrate how to check the exact influence of the prior (mis-) specification. Thereafter, we show by means of a simulation the situations in which the Bayesian approach outperforms the default, maximum likelihood and approach. Finally, we re-analyze empirical data on burn survivors which provided preliminary evidence of an aversive influence of a period of mechanical ventilation on the course of PTSS following burns.\n\nResults\nNot suprisingly, maximum likelihood estimation showed insufficient coverage as well as power with very small samples. Only when Bayesian analysis, in conjunction with informative priors, was used power increased to acceptable levels. As expected, we showed that the smaller the sample size the more the results rely on the prior specification.\n\nConclusion\nWe show that two issues often encountered during analysis of small samples, power and biased parameters, can be solved by including prior information into Bayesian analysis. We argue that the use of informative priors should always be reported together with a sensitivity analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Schoot","given":"Rens","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Broere","given":"Joris J."},{"family":"Perryck","given":"Koen H."},{"family":"Zondervan-Zwijnenburg","given":"Mariëlle"},{"family":"Loey","given":"Nancy E.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"vandeschoot_2015","container-title":"European Journal of Psychotraumatology","container-title-short":"Eur J Psychotraumatol","DOI":"10.3402/ejpt.v6.25216","ISSN":"2000-8198","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,11]]},"page":"10.3402/ejpt.v6.25216","PMCID":"PMC4357639","PMID":"25765534","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Analyzing small data sets using Bayesian estimation: the case of posttraumatic stress symptoms following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors","title-short":"Analyzing small data sets using Bayesian estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4357639/","volume":"6"},

Among the collected data were comorbidity, clinical and pathological tumor stage, tumor grade, nodal status (y)pN, and OS. Case–control matching of 412 patients was performed to compare oncological outcomes. Kaplan–Meier curves were created to estimate OS for patients who underwent RC with or without NAC, and for those with complete response (pCR), partial response (pPR), or residual or progressive disease (PD).\n\nResults\nPatients with a pCR or pPR at RC, with or without NAC, had better OS than patients who had PD (both p values < 0.001). Moreover, the incidence of pCR was significantly higher in patients receiving NAC prior to RC than in patients undergoing RC only (31% versus 15%, respectively; p < 0.001). Case–control matching displayed better OS of patients who underwent RC with NAC, median survival not reached, than of those who underwent RC only, median 4.5 years (p = 0.023).\n\nConclusions\nThis study showed that patients with MIBC who underwent NAC with RC had a significant better OS than those who underwent RC only. The proportion of patients with a pCR was higher in those who received NAC and RC than in those who were treated by RC only. The favorable OS rate in the NAC and RC cohort was probably attributed to the higher observed pCR rate.\n\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11255-022-03339-6.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ginkel","given":"Noor","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hermans","given":"Tom J.

Here we show the predictive capacity of integrating medical imaging, histopathologic and genomic features to predict immunotherapy response using a cohort of 247 patients with advanced NSCLC with multimodal baseline data obtained during diagnostic clinical workup, including computed tomography scan images, digitized programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry slides and known outcomes to immunotherapy. Using domain expert annotations, we developed a computational workflow to extract patient-level features and used a machine-learning approach to integrate multimodal features into a risk prediction model. Our multimodal model (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.86) outperformed unimodal measures, including tumor mutational burden (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.70) and programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry score (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.81). Our study therefore provides a quantitative rationale for using multimodal features to improve prediction of immunotherapy response in patients with NSCLC using expert-guided machine learning.","author":[{"family":"Vanguri","given":"Rami S."},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Aukerman","given":"Andrew T."},{"family":"Egger","given":"Jacklynn V."},{"family":"Fong","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Horvat","given":"Natally"},{"family":"Pagano","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Araujo-Filho","given":"Jose de Arimateia Batista"},{"family":"Geneslaw","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Rizvi","given":"Hira"},{"family":"Sosa","given":"Ramon"},{"family":"Boehm","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Soo-Ryum"},{"family":"Bodd","given":"Francis M."},{"family":"Ventura","given":"Katia"},{"family":"Hollmann","given":"Travis J."},{"family":"Ginsberg","given":"Michelle S."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jianjiong"},{"literal":"MSK MIND Consortium"},{"family":"Hellmann","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Sauter","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Shah","given":"Sohrab P."}],"citation-key":"vanguriMultimodalIntegrationRadiology2022","container-title":"Nature Cancer","container-title-short":"Nat Cancer","DOI":"10.1038/s43018-022-00416-8","ISSN":"2662-1347","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"eng","page":"1151-1164","PMCID":"PMC9586871","PMID":"36038778","source":"PubMed","title":"Multimodal integration of radiology, pathology and genomics for prediction of response to PD-(L)1 blockade in patients with non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

If this is true, counterfactual thinking (e.g. 'If I had left the office earlier, I wouldn't have missed my train.') should also activate this network. Present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explores the common and distinct neural activity of counterfactual and episodic thinking by directly comparing the imagining of upward counterfactuals (creating better outcomes for negative past events) with the re-experiencing of negative past events and the imagining of positive future events. Results confirm that episodic and counterfactual thinking share a common brain network, involving a core memory network (hippocampal area, temporal lobes, midline, and lateral parietal lobes) and prefrontal areas that might be related to mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex) and performance monitoring (right prefrontal cortex). In contrast to episodic past and future thinking, counterfactual thinking recruits some of these areas more strongly and extensively, and additionally activates the bilateral inferior parietal lobe and posterior medial frontal cortex. We discuss these findings in view of recent fMRI evidence on the working of episodic memory and theory of mind.","author":[{"family":"Van Hoeck","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Ampe","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Baetens","given":"Kris"},{"family":"Vandekerckhove","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Van Overwalle","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"VanHoeck2013","container-title":"Social cognitive and affective neuroscience","event-place":"Department of Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussel, Belgium. nicole.van.hoeck@vub.ac.be.","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"number":"5","page":"556-564","publisher-place":"Department of Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Pleinlaan 2, 1050 Brussel, Belgium. nicole.van.hoeck@vub.ac.be.","title":"Counterfactual thinking: an fMRI study on changing the past for a better future.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=22403155&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"vaniterson:2013","abstract":"In the design of microarray or next-generation sequencing experiments it is crucial to choose the appropriate number of biological replicates. As often the number of differentially expressed genes and their effect sizes are small and too few replicates will lead to insufficient power to detect these. On the other hand, too many replicates unnecessary leads to high experimental costs. Power and sample size analysis can guide experimentalist in choosing the appropriate number of biological replicates. Several methods for power and sample size analysis have recently been proposed for microarray data. However, most of these are restricted to two group comparisons and require user-defined effect sizes. Here we propose a pilot-data based method for power and sample size analysis which can handle more general experimental designs and uses pilot-data to obtain estimates of the effect sizes. The method can also handle χ2 distributed test statistics which enables power and sample size calculations for a much wider class of models, including high-dimensional generalized linear models which are used, e.g., for RNA-seq data analysis. The performance of the method is evaluated using simulated and experimental data from several microarray and next-generation sequencing experiments. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method for estimation of the density of effect sizes from pilot data with a recent proposed method specific for two group comparisons.","author":[{"family":"Iterson","given":"Maarten","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Wiel","given":"Mark A.","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Boer","given":"Judith M."},{"family":"Menezes","given":"Renée X.","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"vaniterson:2013","container-title":"Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol","DOI":"10.1515/sagmb-2012-0046","ISSN":"1544-6115","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"449-467","PMID":"23934609","source":"PubMed","title":"General power and sample size calculations for high-dimensional genomic data","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

The purpose of this study is to use the  Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) prospective  registry to validate historical principles of LN in a contemporary, real-world  cohort. After an extensive literature review, six principles of LN in cSLE were  identified. The CARRA registry was queried to evaluate these principles in  determining the rate of LN in cSLE, median time from cSLE diagnosis to LN,  short-term renal outcomes, and frequency of rituximab as an induction therapy. Of  the 677 cSLE patients in the CARRA registry, 32% had documented LN. Decline in  kidney function was more common in Black cSLE patients than non-Black patients  (p = 0.04). Black race was associated with worse short-term renal outcomes. In  short-term follow up, most children with LN had unchanged or improved kidney  function, and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) was rare. Ongoing follow-up of cSLE  patients in the CARRA registry will be necessary to evaluate long-term outcomes  to inform risk, management, and prognosis of LN in cSLE.","author":[{"family":"Vazzana","given":"Kathleen M."},{"family":"Daga","given":"Ankana"},{"family":"Goilav","given":"Beatrice"},{"family":"Ogbu","given":"Ekemini A."},{"family":"Okamura","given":"Daryl M."},{"family":"Park","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Sadun","given":"Rebecca E."},{"family":"Smitherman","given":"Emily A."},{"family":"Stotter","given":"Brian R."},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Knight","given":"Andrea M."},{"family":"Hersh","given":"Aimee O."},{"family":"Wenderfer","given":"Scott E."},{"family":"Lewandowski","given":"Laura B."}],"citation-key":"vazzana_2021","container-title":"Lupus","container-title-short":"Lupus","DOI":"10.1177/09612033211028658","event-place":"England","ISSN":"1477-0962 0961-2033","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"1660-1670","PMCID":"PMC10461610","PMID":"34219529","publisher-place":"England","title":"Principles of pediatric lupus nephritis in a prospective contemporary multi-center cohort.","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"vega:2022","abstract":"Purpose\n\nAs immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) become increasingly used in frontline settings, identifying early indicators of response is needed. Recent studies suggest a role for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in monitoring response to ICI, but uncertainty exists in the generalizability of these studies. Here, the role of ctDNA for monitoring response to ICI is assessed through a standardized approach by assessing clinical trial data from five independent studies.\nPatients and Methods\n\nPatient-level clinical and ctDNA data were pooled and harmonized from 200 patients across five independent clinical trials investigating the treatment of patients with non–small-cell lung cancer with programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)–directed monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. CtDNA levels were measured using different ctDNA assays across the studies. Maximum variant allele frequencies were calculated using all somatic tumor-derived variants in each unique patient sample to correlate ctDNA changes with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).\nResults\n\nWe observed strong associations between reductions in ctDNA levels from on-treatment liquid biopsies with improved OS (OS; hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.20; P < .001) and PFS (PFS; hazard ratio 1.76; 95% CI, 1.31 to 2.36; P < .001). Changes in the maximum variant allele frequencies ctDNA values showed strong association across different outcomes.\nConclusion\n\nIn this pooled analysis of five independent clinical trials, consistent and robust associations between reductions in ctDNA and outcomes were found across multiple end points assessed in patients with non–small-cell lung cancer treated with an ICI. Additional tumor types, stages, and drug classes should be included in future analyses to further validate this. CtDNA may serve as an important tool in clinical development and an early indicator of treatment benefit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Vega","given":"Diana Merino"},{"family":"Nishimura","given":"Katherine K."},{"family":"Zariffa","given":"Névine"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Hoering","given":"Antje"},{"family":"Cilento","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Anagnostou","given":"Valsamo"},{"family":"Baden","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Beaver","given":"Julia A."},{"family":"Chaudhuri","given":"Aadel A."},{"family":"Chudova","given":"Darya"},{"family":"Fine","given":"Alexander D."},{"family":"Fiore","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Hodge","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Hodgson","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Hunkapiller","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Klass","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Kobie","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Peña","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Pennello","given":"Gene"},{"family":"Peterman","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Philip","given":"Reena"},{"family":"Quinn","given":"Katie J."},{"family":"Raben","given":"David"},{"family":"Rosner","given":"Gary L."},{"family":"Sausen","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Tezcan","given":"Ayse"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Young","given":"Amanda G."},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Mark D."},{"family":"Carpenter","given":"Erica L."},{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Charu"},{"family":"Allen","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"vega:2022","container-title":"JCO Precision Oncology","container-title-short":"JCO Precis Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/PO.21.00372","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"page":"e2100372","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"ascopubs.org (Atypon)","title":"Changes in Circulating Tumor DNA Reflect Clinical Benefit Across Multiple Studies of Patients With Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/PO.21.00372"},

  {"id":"vetterDiagnosticTestingDecisionMaking2018","abstract":"To use a diagnostic test effectively and consistently in their practice, clinicians need to know how well the test distinguishes between those patients who have the suspected acute or chronic disease and those patients who do not. Clinicians are equally interested and usually more concerned whether, based on the results of a screening test, a given patient actually: (1) does or does not have the suspected disease; or (2) will or will not subsequently experience the adverse event or outcome. Medical tests that are performed to screen for a risk factor, diagnose a disease, or to estimate a patient’s prognosis are frequently a key component of a clinical research study. Like therapeutic interventions, medical tests require proper analysis and demonstrated efficacy before being incorporated into routine clinical practice. This basic statistical tutorial, thus, discusses the fundamental concepts and techniques related to diagnostic testing and medical decision-making, including sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, receiver operating characteristic curve, diagnostic accuracy, choosing a best cut-point for a continuous variable biomarker, comparing methods on diagnostic accuracy, and design of a diagnostic accuracy study.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vetter","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Schober","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Mascha","given":"Edward J."}],"citation-key":"vetterDiagnosticTestingDecisionMaking2018","container-title":"Anesthesia & Analgesia","DOI":"10.1213/ANE.0000000000003698","ISSN":"0003-2999","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en-US","page":"1085","source":"journals.lww.com","title":"Diagnostic Testing and Decision-Making: Beauty Is Not Just in the Eye of the Beholder","title-short":"Diagnostic Testing and Decision-Making","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/fulltext/2018/10000/diagnostic_testing_and_decision_making__beauty_is.39.aspx","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"vickers_2008","abstract":"The traditional statistical approach to the evaluation of diagnostic tests, prediction models, and molecular markers is to assess their accuracy, using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver-operating-characteristic curve. However, there is no obvious association between accuracy and clinical value: it is unclear, for example, just how accurate a test needs to be in order for it to be considered “accurate enough” to warrant its use in patient care. Decision analysis aims to assess the clinical value of a test by assigning weights to each possible consequence. These methods have been historically considered unattractive to the practicing biostatistician because additional data from the literature, or subjective assessments from individual patients or clinicians, are needed in order to assign weights appropriately. Decision analytic methods are available that can reduce these additional requirements. These methods can provide insight into the consequences of using a test, model, or marker in clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Vickers","given":"Andrew J"}],"citation-key":"vickers_2008","container-title":"The American Statistician","container-title-short":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1198/000313008X370302","ISSN":"0003-1305, 1537-2731","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11]]},"language":"en","page":"314-320","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Decision Analysis for the Evaluation of Diagnostic Tests, Prediction Models, and Molecular Markers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/000313008X370302","volume":"62"},

Predictive models are built by inferring from the censored variable in time-to-event data, which diﬀerentiates them from other regression methods. Censoring is represented as a binary indicator variable and machine learning methods have been tuned to account for the censored attribute. Active learning from censored data using survival regression methods can make the model query a domain expert for the timeto-event label of the sampled instances. This oﬀers higher advantages in the healthcare domain where a domain expert can interactively reﬁne the model with his feedback. With this motivation, we address this problem by providing an active learning based survival model which uses a novel model discriminative gradient based sampling scheme. We evaluate this framework on electronic health records (EHR), publicly available survival and synthetic censored datasets of varying diversity. Experimental evaluation against state of the art survival regression methods indicates the higher discriminative ability of the proposed approach.

  {"id":"vockAdaptingMachineLearning2016","abstract":"Models for predicting the probability of experiencing various health outcomes or adverse events over a certain time frame (e.g., having a heart attack in the next 5 years) based on individual patient characteristics are important tools for managing patient care. Electronic health data (EHD) are appealing sources of training data because they provide access to large amounts of rich individual-level data from present-day patient populations. However, because EHD are derived by extracting information from administrative and clinical databases, some fraction of subjects will not be under observation for the entire time frame over which one wants to make predictions; this loss to follow-up is often due to disenrollment from the health system. For subjects without complete follow-up, whether or not they experienced the adverse event is unknown, and in statistical terms the event time is said to be right-censored. Most machine learning approaches to the problem have been relatively ad hoc; for example, common approaches for handling observations in which the event status is unknown include (1) discarding those observations, (2) treating them as non-events, (3) splitting those observations into two observations: one where the event occurs and one where the event does not. In this paper, we present a general-purpose approach to account for right-censored outcomes using inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). We illustrate how IPCW can easily be incorporated into a number of existing machine learning algorithms used to mine big health care data including Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and generalized additive models. We then show that our approach leads to better calibrated predictions than the three ad hoc approaches when applied to predicting the 5-year risk of experiencing a cardiovascular adverse event, using EHD from a large U.S. Midwestern healthcare system.","author":[{"family":"Vock","given":"David M"}],"citation-key":"vockAdaptingMachineLearning2016","container-title":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"13","source":"Zotero","title":"Adapting machine learning techniques to censored time-to-event health record data: A general-purpose approach using inverse probability of censoring weighting","type":"article-journal"},

When using quantitative biomarkers for classification purposes, this often implies that an appropriate cutoff for the biomarker has to be determined and its clinical utility must be assessed. In the context of drug development, it is of interest how the probability of response changes with increasing values of the biomarker. Unlike sensitivity and specificity, predictive values are functions of the accuracy of the test, depend on the prevalence of the disease and therefore are a useful tool in this setting. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to not only estimate the cutoff value using the negative and positive predictive values, but also estimate the uncertainty around this estimate. Using Bayesian inference allows us to incorporate prior information, and obtain posterior estimates and credible intervals for the cut-off and associated predictive values. The performance of the Bayesian approach is compared with alternative methods via simulation studies of bias, interval coverage and width and illustrations on real data with binary and time-to-event outcomes are provided.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Vradi","given":"Eleni"},{"family":"Jaki","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Vonk","given":"Richardus"},{"family":"Brannath","given":"Werner"}],"citation-key":"vradiBayesianModelEstimate2019","container-title":"Statistical Methods in Medical Research","container-title-short":"Stat Methods Med Res","DOI":"10.1177/0962280218784778","ISSN":"0962-2802","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2538-2556","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd STM","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"A Bayesian model to estimate the cutoff and the clinical utility of a biomarker assay","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280218784778","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"waingankar_2019","abstract":"Purpose: Achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is associated with a favorable prognosis. Patients with pathologic residual disease (pRD) generally have poor outcomes. However, prognosis after radical cystectomy (RC) improves with ongoing survivorship. Our objective was to determine whether the difference in prognosis of patients with pCR and pRD changes over time. Materials and Methods: We queried the National Cancer Database for patients who received NAC and RC for localized MIBC (cT2T4aN0M0) between 1998 and 2012. pCR was deﬁned as ≤Tis disease. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate conditional survival to 5 years given survival to 1, 2, 3, and 4 years post-RC. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate the effect of pRD vs. pCR on overall survival.\nResults: The cohort comprised 1,553 patients (pCR: 314 and pRD: 1,239). With median follow-up 2.65 years (range 0.01−9.97), median survival was 2.5 years (95% conﬁdence interval 2.2−2.9) and not reached for pRD and pCR, respectively. All patients had improved conditional survival with each additional year of survivorship. Patients with pCR had improved overall survival relative to those with pRD. The effect of pRD vs. pCR on conditional survival did not differ over time (P = 0.7).\nConclusions: MIBC patients with pCR after NAC have improved conditional survival relative to those with pRD post-RC. This survival advantage does not signiﬁcantly change over time. These ﬁndings may inform patient counseling, surveillance intensity, and novel adjuvant approaches for patients with pRD.

In this paper, we propose a boosting algorithm tackling these challenges by being able to simultaneously estimate predictors for joint models and automatically select the most influential variables even in high-dimensional data situations. We analyze the performance of the new algorithm in a simulation study and apply it to the Danish cystic fibrosis registry that collects longitudinal lung function data on patients with cystic fibrosis together with data regarding the onset of pulmonary infections.

Examples include situations where one requires local estimates of PAR for a study subset (e.g., in states or counties within a national study) or if one wishes to apply the findings of an epidemiologic study to another population. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A framework for estimating local PAR values is developed, and then illustrated using synthetic and empirical data. RESULTS: A general expression for the variance of a local PAR estimate is formulated. It involves three components, reflecting (1) the variance of the disease relative risk associated with exposure to a risk factor, (2) the variance of the exposure prevalence (P), and (3) their covariance. The effects of variable stratum sizes, case-control sample size ratios, and variation in exposure P are illustrated by some synthetic scenarios, and with data from an international case-control study of heart disease. CONCLUSION: The precision of local PAR estimates can be considerably improved by incorporating external data, as opposed to limiting the calculation to data only from the local population.

  {"id":"wang_2020","abstract":"High-throughput testing of drugs across molecular-characterised cell lines can identify candidate treatments and discover biomarkers. However, the cells’ response to a drug is typically quantified by a summary statistic from a best-fit dose-response curve, whilst neglecting the uncertainty of the curve fit and the potential variability in the raw readouts. Here, we model the experimental variance using Gaussian Processes, and subsequently, leverage uncertainty estimates to identify associated biomarkers with a new Bayesian framework. Applied to in vitro screening data on 265 compounds across 1074 cancer cell lines, our models identified 24 clinically established drug-response biomarkers, and provided evidence for six novel biomarkers by accounting for association with low uncertainty. We validated our uncertainty estimates with an additional drug screen of 26 drugs, 10 cell lines with 8 to 9 replicates. Our method is applicable to any dose-response data without replicates, and improves biomarker discovery for precision medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Hensman","given":"James"},{"family":"Kutkaite","given":"Ginte"},{"family":"Toh","given":"Tzen S"},{"family":"Galhoz","given":"Ana"},{"literal":"GDSC Screening Team"},{"family":"Dry","given":"Jonathan R"},{"family":"Saez-Rodriguez","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Garnett","given":"Mathew J"},{"family":"Menden","given":"Michael P"},{"family":"Dondelinger","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"wang_2020","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.60352","editor":[{"family":"Lehár","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Weigel","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"Blocker","given":"Alexander W"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,4]]},"page":"e60352","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"A statistical framework for assessing pharmacological responses and biomarkers using uncertainty estimates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60352","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"Wang:2018","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of 6 tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) in treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) at 12 weeks and 24 weeks. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials of TNFi in patients with active AS. We included trials that reported efficacy at 10 to 14 weeks (12-week analysis) and at 24 to 30 weeks (24-week analysis). We used Bayesian network metaanalysis (NMA) to compare their relative efficacy to improve the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. RESULTS: We included 20 trials of 6 TNFi, with 43 treatment arms and 3220 participants. All TNFi were significantly better than placebo in reducing BASDAI and BASFI at 12 weeks and 24 weeks; all but certolizumab pegol (CZP) were statistically better than placebo in reducing CRP at 12 weeks; all but CZP and infliximab-dyyb (IFX biosimilar) were significantly better than placebo in reducing CRP at 24 weeks. IFX was superior to the other TNFi in decreasing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but not at 24 weeks. Excluding 1 open-label trial, there were no differences among TNFi. CONCLUSION: Based on this NMA of clinical trials, IFX was superior to other TNFi in reducing BASDAI at 12 weeks, but sensitive to inclusion of an open-label trial, and its efficacy was diminished at 24 weeks. The analysis was limited by few direct comparison trials. Further study of relative safety and longterm effectiveness will help inform the choice of TNFi in treating active AS.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Runsheng"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael M"}],"citation-key":"Wang:2018","container-title":"The Journal of Rheumatology","container-title-short":"The Journal of Rheumatology","DOI":"10.3899/jrheum.170224","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"page":"481–490","PMID":"29335342","publisher":"The Journal of Rheumatology","title":"Comparative efficacy of tumor necrosis factor-<span class=\"nocase\">α</span> inhibitors in ankylosing spondylitis: a systematic review and bayesian network metaanalysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.170224","volume":"45"},

Different from some commonly seen model fitting criteria in statistics, such as the ordinary least squares criterion and the maximum likelihood method, its algorithm depends on an optimization problem under constraints, which is unconventional to many students in a second or third course in statistics or data science. As a result, this topic is often not as intuitive to students as some of the more traditional statistical modeling tools. In order to facilitate students’ mastery of the topic and promote active learning, we developed some in-class activities and their accompanying Shiny applications for teaching support vector classifiers. The designed course materials aim at engaging students through group work and solidifying students’ understanding of the algorithm via hands-on explorations. The Shiny applications offer interactive demonstration of the changes of the components of a support vector classifier when altering its determining parameters. With the goal of benefiting the broader statistics and data science education community, we have made the developed Shiny applications publicly available.

Efficacy outcomes were the change in pain score and change in the duration of morning stiffness. We also examined the number of adverse events. We used Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare effects directly and indirectly between drugs. We included 26 trials (66 treatment arms) of 20 NSAIDs with 3410 participants in the network meta-analysis. Fifty-eight per cent of trials had fewer than 50 participants. All 20 NSAIDs reduced pain more than placebo (standardised mean difference ranging from -0.65 to -2.2), with 15 NSAIDs significantly better than placebo. Etoricoxib was superior to celecoxib, ketoprofen and tenoxicam in pain reduction, but no other interdrug comparisons were significant. There were no significant differences among NSAIDs in decreases in the duration of morning stiffness or the likelihood of adverse events. Adverse events were uncommon in these short-term studies. In 16 trials that used NSAIDs at full doses, etoricoxib was superior to all but two other NSAIDs in pain reduction. Etoricoxib was more effective in reducing pain in AS than some other NSAIDs, but there was otherwise insufficient evidence to conclude that any particular NSAID was more effective in the treatment of AS.

We introduce the scGNN (single-cell graph neural network) to provide a hypothesis-free deep learning framework for scRNA-Seq analyses. This framework formulates and aggregates cell–cell relationships with graph neural networks and models heterogeneous gene expression patterns using a left-truncated mixture Gaussian model. scGNN integrates three iterative multi-modal autoencoders and outperforms existing tools for gene imputation and cell clustering on four benchmark scRNA-Seq datasets. In an Alzheimer’s disease study with 13,214 single nuclei from postmortem brain tissues, scGNN successfully illustrated disease-related neural development and the differential mechanism. scGNN provides an effective representation of gene expression and cell–cell relationships. It is also a powerful framework that can be applied to general scRNA-Seq analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Juexin"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Anjun"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Yuzhou"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Jianting"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yuexu"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Ren"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Cankun"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Hongjun"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dong"}],"citation-key":"wangScGNNNovelGraph2021","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-22197-x","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1882","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"scGNN is a novel graph neural network framework for single-cell RNA-Seq analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22197-x","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"wangShapleyFlowGraphbased2020","abstract":"Many existing approaches for estimating feature importance are problematic because they ignore or hide dependencies among features. A causal graph, which encodes the relationships among input variables, can aid in assigning feature importance. However, current approaches that assign credit to nodes in the causal graph fail to explain the entire graph. In light of these limitations, we propose Shapley Flow, a novel approach to interpreting machine learning models. It considers the entire causal graph, and assigns credit to \\textit{edges} instead of treating nodes as the fundamental unit of credit assignment. Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization of the Shapley value axioms to directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a model's input on its output. In addition to maintaining insights from existing approaches, Shapley Flow extends the flat, set-based, view prevalent in game theory based explanation methods to a deeper, \\textit{graph-based}, view. This graph-based view enables users to understand the flow of importance through a system, and reason about potential interventions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiaxuan"},{"family":"Wiens","given":"Jenna"},{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"wangShapleyFlowGraphbased2020","container-title":"arXiv:2010.14592 [cs, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,27]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"Shapley Flow: A Graph-based Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions","title-short":"Shapley Flow","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14592"},

  {"id":"wangUnsupervisedMachineLearning2020","abstract":"Machine learning has become ubiquitous and a key technology on mining electronic health records (EHRs) for facilitating clinical research and practice. Unsupervised machine learning, as opposed to supervised learning, has shown promise in identifying novel patterns and relations from EHRs without using human created labels. In this paper, we investigate the application of unsupervised machine learning models in discovering latent disease clusters and patient subgroups based on EHRs. We utilized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model, and proposed a novel model named Poisson Dirichlet Model (PDM), which extends the LDA approach using a Poisson distribution to model patients' disease diagnoses and to alleviate age and sex factors by considering both observed and expected observations. In the empirical experiments, we evaluated LDA and PDM on three patient cohorts, namely Osteoporosis, Delirium/Dementia, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Bronchiectasis Cohorts, with their EHR data retrieved from the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) medical records linkage system, for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups. We compared the effectiveness of LDA and PDM in identifying disease clusters through the visualization of disease representations. We tested the performance of LDA and PDM in differentiating patient subgroups through survival analysis, as well as statistical analysis of demographics and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (ECI) scores in those subgroups. The experimental results show that the proposed PDM could effectively identify distinguished disease clusters based on the latent patterns hidden in the EHR data by alleviating the impact of age and sex, and that LDA could stratify patients into differentiable subgroups with larger p-values than PDM. However, those subgroups identified by LDA are highly associated with patients' age and sex. The subgroups discovered by PDM might imply the underlying patterns of diseases of greater interest in epidemiology research due to the alleviation of age and sex. Both unsupervised machine learning approaches could be leveraged to discover patient subgroups using EHRs but with different foci.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanshan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yiqing"},{"family":"Therneau","given":"Terry M."},{"family":"Atkinson","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Tafti","given":"Ahmad P."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Shreyasee"},{"family":"Limper","given":"Andrew H."},{"family":"Khosla","given":"Sundeep"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hongfang"}],"citation-key":"wangUnsupervisedMachineLearning2020","container-title":"Journal of Biomedical Informatics","container-title-short":"J Biomed Inform","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103364","ISSN":"1532-0480","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"103364","PMCID":"PMC7028517","PMID":"31891765","source":"PubMed","title":"Unsupervised machine learning for the discovery of latent disease clusters and patient subgroups using electronic health records","type":"article-journal","volume":"102"},

  {"id":"Ward2017","abstract":"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the patient global assessment (PGA) has been strongly associated with pain severity, but less often with other measures, including disease activity measures. We tested whether RA activity and psychological measures had direct associations with the PGA or indirect associations that were mediated by pain. We also tested whether the correlates of the PGA differed with the degree of RA activity. We studied 260 patients with active RA on 2 visits in a prospective longitudinal study. We used path analysis to test direct and indirect associations of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), fatigue, physical role limitations, social functioning, depressive symptoms, and health distress with the PGA. Among the 509 visits, the median PGA score was 50 (25th-75th percentile: 24-66). Pain severity had the strongest association with the PGA, but direct associations were also found for morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28. Morning stiffness severity, DAS28, health distress, and HAQ were also indirectly associated with the PGA through pain. Among visits with DAS28 ¿= 5.4, pain, morning stiffness severity, and HAQ were the only determinants of the PGA. Among visits with DAS28 ¡4.2, health distress and age were additional determinants, and fatigue was marginally associated with the PGA. Although pain was the strongest determinant of the PGA in RA, morning stiffness severity, health distress, fatigue, and DAS28 were also important.

We undertook this study to examine the relationship between methotrexate (MTX) use and mortality in RA, after controlling for individual propensity scores for MTX use. METHODS: We studied 5,626 RA patients prospectively for 25 years to determine the risk of death associated with MTX use, modeled in time-varying Cox regression models. We used the random forest method to generate individual propensity scores for MTX use at study entry and during followup in a time-varying manner; these scores were included in the multivariate model. We also investigated whether selective discontinuation of MTX immediately prior to death altered the risk of mortality, and we examined the association of duration of MTX use with survival. RESULTS: During followup, 666 patients (12%) died. MTX use was associated with reduced risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30 [95% confidence interval 0.09-1.03]). Selective MTX cessation immediately before death did not account for the protective association of MTX use with mortality.

  {"id":"Wasko2015","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Medications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may affect survival. However, studies often include limited follow-up and do not account for selection bias in treatment allocation. Using a large longitudinal database, we examined the association between prednisone use and mortality in RA, and whether this risk was modified with concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use, after controlling for propensity for treatment with prednisone and individual DMARDs. METHODS: In a prospective study of 5,626 patients with RA followed for up to 25 years, we determined the risk of death associated with prednisone use alone and combined treatment of prednisone with methotrexate or sulfasalazine. We used the random forest method to generate propensity scores for prednisone use and each DMARD at study entry and during follow-up. Mortality risks were estimated using multivariate Cox models that included propensity scores. RESULTS: During follow-up (median 4.97 years), 666 patients (11.8%) died. In a multivariate, propensity-adjusted model, prednisone use was associated with an increased risk of death (HR 2.83 [95% CI 1.03, 7.76]). However, there was a significant interaction between prednisone use and methotrexate use (p=0.03), so that risk was attenuated when patients were treated with both medications (HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.18, 5.36]). However, combination treatment also weakened the protective association of methotrexate with mortality. Results were similar for sulfasalazine. CONCLUSION: Prednisone use was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality in patients with RA. This association was mitigated by concomitant DMARD use, but combined treatment also negated the previously reported beneficial association of methotrexate with survival in RA.

FDA's guidance on covariate adjustment encourages the judicious use of baseline covariates to enhance efficiency. Careful consideration is required when adjusting for covariates in nonlinear models such as logistic regression and Cox regression. For these nonlinear models, including baseline covariates can change the targeted treatment effect (estimand). It is also crucial that the proposed statistical analyses align with the estimand of interest. Covariate-adjusted estimators used for unconditional treatment effect are typically robust to misspecification of the used regression models. Despite extensive literature and recommendations by the FDA on the statistical theory and properties of these methods, the real-life application of such methodologies is still limited. Moreover, a few open questions require further discussion, especially for time-to-event outcomes. In this paper, we present causal estimands definition of conditional and unconditional treatment effects in randomized clinical trials. We also evaluate different estimation methods for estimating conditional and unconditional treatment effects for the binary and time-to-event endpoints.

All four alternatives have advantages and disadvantages compared with logistic regression.

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.","author":[{"family":"Westreich","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Greenland","given":"Sander"}],"citation-key":"westreichTableFallacyPresenting2013","container-title":"American Journal of Epidemiology","container-title-short":"Am.

It is required that the trial should be large enough to ensure that the data collected will provide convincing evidence either that an experimental treatment is better than a control or that it fails to improve upon control by some clinically relevant difference. The method resembles standard frequentist formulations of the problem, and indeed in certain circumstances involving ‘non‐informative’ prior information it leads to identical answers. In particular, unlike many Bayesian approaches to sample size determination, use is made of an alternative hypothesis that an experimental treatment is better than a control treatment by some specified magnitude. The approach is introduced in the context of testing whether a single stream of binary observations are consistent with a given success rate\n              p\n              0\n              . Next the case of comparing two independent streams of normally distributed responses is considered, first under the assumption that their common variance is known and then for unknown variance.

Here, we introduce different classes of method, which either record the locations of hybridized mRNA molecules in tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to assessment, or employ spatial arrays of mRNA probes of pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including pre-processing, integration with existing scRNA-seq data, and inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are already improving our understanding of human tissues in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Cameron G."},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hyun Jae"},{"family":"Asatsuma","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Vento-Tormo","given":"Roser"},{"family":"Haque","given":"Ashraful"}],"citation-key":"williams_2022","container-title":"Genome Medicine","container-title-short":"Genome Med","DOI":"10.1186/s13073-022-01075-1","ISSN":"1756-994X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,27]]},"language":"en","page":"68","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An introduction to spatial transcriptomics for biomedical research","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-022-01075-1","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"Williams2010","abstract":"The expression of protein phosphatase 32 (PP32, ANP32A) is low in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancers and is linked to the levels of HuR (ELAV1), a predictive marker for gemcitabine response. In pancreatic cancer cells, exogenous overexpression of pp32 inhibited cell growth, supporting its long-recognized role as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer. In chemotherapeutic sensitivity screening assays, cells overexpressing pp32 were selectively resistant to the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and cytarabine (ARA-C), but were sensitized to 5-fluorouracil; conversely, silencing pp32 in pancreatic cancer cells enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity. The cytoplasmic levels of pp32 increased after cancer cells are treated with certain stressors, including gemcitabine. pp32 overexpression reduced the association of HuR with the mRNA encoding the gemcitabine-metabolizing enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), causing a significant reduction in dCK protein levels. Similarly, ectopic pp32 expression caused a reduction in HuR binding of mRNAs encoding tumor-promoting proteins (e.g., VEGF and HuR), while silencing pp32 dramatically enhanced the binding of these mRNA targets. Low pp32 nuclear expression correlated with high-grade tumors and the presence of lymph node metastasis, as compared to patients' tumors with high nuclear pp32 expression. Although pp32 expression levels did not enhance the predictive power of cytoplasmic HuR status, nuclear pp32 levels and cytoplasmic HuR levels associated significantly in patient samples. Thus, we provide novel evidence that the tumor suppressor function of pp32 can be attributed to its ability to disrupt HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding key proteins for cancer cell survival and drug efficacy.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Timothy K"},{"family":"Costantino","given":"Christina L"},{"family":"Bildzukewicz","given":"Nikolai A"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Nathan G"},{"family":"Rittenhouse","given":"David W"},{"family":"Einstein","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Cozzitorto","given":"Joseph A"},{"family":"Keen","given":"Judith C"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Gorospe","given":"Myriam"},{"family":"Gonye","given":"Gregory E"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Charles J"},{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jonathan R"}],"citation-key":"Williams2010","container-title":"PloS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015455","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1932-6203 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"e15455","PMID":"21152064","publisher-place":"United States","title":"pp32 (ANP32A) expression inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth and induces gemcitabine resistance by disrupting HuR binding to mRNAs.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0015455","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"Winham2012","abstract":"Identifying variants associated with complex human traits in high-dimensional data is a central goal of genome-wide association studies. However, complicated etiologies such as gene-gene interactions are ignored by the univariate analysis usually applied in these studies. Random Forests (RF) are a popular data-mining technique that can accommodate a large number of predictor variables and allow for complex models with interactions. RF analysis produces measures of variable importance that can be used to rank the predictor variables. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using RFs is gaining popularity as a potential filter approach that considers interactions in high-dimensional data. However, the impact of data dimensionality on the power of RF to identify interactions has not been thoroughly explored. We investigate the ability of rankings from variable importance measures to detect gene-gene interaction effects and their potential effectiveness as filters compared to p-values from univariate logistic regression, particularly as the data becomes increasingly high-dimensional.RF effectively identifies interactions in low dimensional data. As the total number of predictor variables increases, probability of detection declines more rapidly for interacting SNPs than for non-interacting SNPs, indicating that in high-dimensional data the RF variable importance measures are capturing marginal effects rather than capturing the effects of interactions.While RF remains a promising data-mining technique that extends univariate methods to condition on multiple variables simultaneously, RF variable importance measures fail to detect interaction effects in high-dimensional data in the absence of a strong marginal component, and therefore may not be useful as a filter technique that allows for interaction effects in genome-wide data.","author":[{"family":"Winham","given":"Stacey J"},{"family":"Colby","given":"Colin L"},{"family":"Freimuth","given":"Robert R"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Andrade","given":"Mariza","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Huebner","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Biernacka","given":"Joanna M"}],"citation-key":"Winham2012","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"164","publisher":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"SNP interaction detection with Random Forests in high-dimensional genetic data.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-13-164","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"witjes_2021","abstract":"Radical cystectomy (RC) is the treatment of choice and is strongly recommended for patients with pT2-4aN0M0 bladder cancer in both the European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urological Association (AUA) muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) guidelines. RC is a challenging operation, with significant perioperative and postoperative morbidity and mortality, having short-term complication rates between 14.4% and 21.7%, and long-term oncological survival rates ranging from 60% after 5 years to 43% after 10 years. The impact on quality of life (QoL) in patients after treatment for bladder cancer is significantly worse than in other pelvic cancers. Although RC is strongly recommended as the gold standard, there is a need for bladder-sparing options in MIBC. Attempts to improve mortality and morbidity rates after RC have been made by implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), robot-assisted RC, and sexual function-preserving techniques. None of these significantly improves QoL or functional outcome. Because of the invasiveness of RC, other therapeutic options have been evaluated. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURB) plays an important role in the diagnostic evaluation of MIBC and has also been reviewed as a curative option, although the oncological results appear inferior to RC. Furthermore, improved radiotherapy (RT) and widely used chemotherapy, both as monotherapeutic options in bladder cancer, are not as effective as radical surgery, with lower survival rates. Trimodality treatment (TMT) in bladder cancer combines TURB with chemotherapy and RT. The goal of TMT is preserving the bladder and QoL without compromising oncological outcome. A 2018 review showed no difference in overall survival rates between RC and TMT (30.9% vs 35.1%), with lower survival rates after RC than TMT in the first year of follow-up, probably due to higher postoperative mortality. For a selected group of patients, TMT is to be recommended, and it is the most favorable option out of the organ-sparing strategies in MIBC.","author":[{"family":"Witjes","given":"J.

  {"id":"Witkiewicz2008","abstract":"Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that afflicts over 35,000 Americans every year. Since therapeutic options are limited, understanding the molecular aspects of this disease is critical for moving towards targeted treatment of this aggressive form of cancer. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) are two proteins that have been shown to be dysregulated in a number of cancers. Functionally these proteins have been shown to be involved in the process of tumorigenesis. We thus surveyed the expression of both these critical proteins in a series of pancreatic precancerous lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, PanIN) and pancreatic cancers. Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated predominantly with clinical characteristics, such as histologic grade and advanced tumor stage (e.g., high Cav-1 and FASN expression correlated with poor differentiation status) and a significant survival advantage was found in patients with low co-expressing FASN and Cav-1 tumors. Cav-1 and FASN expression was absent in PanIN lesions and the normal ducts and acini. Of note, Cav-1 expression was detected in the fibroblasts of the desmoplastic pancreatic cancer stroma, but not in stromal cells of the normal pancreas. Mechanistically, these data support the notion that these proteins are co-regulated either directly or indirectly by another factor. Importantly, the co-expression of these proteins significantly correlates with clinical features and survival status of pancreatic cancer patients. Thus, Cav-1 and FASN may functionally cooperate in the process of pancreatic tumorigenesis, and as such, may be good candidate prognostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention.","author":[{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Katherine H"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Kennedy","given":"Eugene P"},{"family":"Yeo","given":"Charles J"},{"family":"Lisanti","given":"Michael P"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jonathan R"}],"citation-key":"Witkiewicz2008","container-title":"Cell Cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1551-4005 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",10]]},"page":"3021-5","PMID":"18802406","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Co-expression of fatty acid synthase and caveolin-1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: implications for tumor progression and clinical outcome.","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Witkiewicz2009","abstract":"Previously, we showed that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) expression is down-regulated in human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts. However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 occurs in the breast tumor stroma in vivo. Here, we immunostained a well-annotated breast cancer tissue microarray with antibodies against Cav-1 and scored its stromal expression. An absence of stromal Cav-1 was associated with early disease recurrence, advanced tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis, resulting in a 3.6-fold reduction in progression-free survival. When tamoxifen-treated patients were selected, an absence of stromal Cav-1 was a strong predictor of poor clinical outcome, suggestive of tamoxifen resistance. Interestingly, in lymph node-positive patients, an absence of stromal Cav-1 predicted an 11.5-fold reduction in 5-year progression-free survival. Clinical outcomes among patients positive for HER2, and patients triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, were also strictly dependent on stromal Cav-1 levels. When our results were adjusted for tumor and nodal staging, an absence of stromal Cav-1 remained an independent predictor of poor outcome. Thus, stromal Cav-1 expression can be used to stratify human breast cancer patients into low-risk and high-risk groups, and to predict their risk of early disease recurrence at diagnosis. Based on related mechanistic studies, we suggest that breast cancer patients lacking stromal Cav-1 might benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy in addition to standard regimens.

  {"id":"Witkiewicz2009b","abstract":"Here, we determined the possible association of stromal caveolin-1 (Cav-1) levels with DCIS recurrence and/or progression to invasive breast cancer. An initial cohort of 78 DCIS patients with follow-up data was examined. As ER-positivity was associated with recurrence, we focused our analysis on this subset of 56 patients. In this group, we observed that DCIS progressed to invasive breast cancer in approximately 14% of the patient population (8/56), in accordance with an expected progression rate of 12-15%. Nearly ninety percent of DCIS patients (7/8) that underwent recurrence to invasive breast cancer had reduced or absent levels of stromal Cav-1. Remarkably, an absence of stromal Cav-1 (score = 0) was specifically associated with early disease progression to invasive breast cancer, with reduced time to recurrence and higher recurrence rate. All DCIS patients with an absence of stromal Cav-1 underwent some form of recurrence (5/5) and the majority (4/5) underwent progression to invasive breast cancer. This represents an overall cumulative incidence rate of 100% for recurrence and 80% for progression. An absence of stromal Cav-1 in DCIS lesions was also specifically associated with the presence of inflammatory cells. Conversely, ninety-seven percent of ER(+) DCIS patients (35/36) with high levels of stromal Cav-1 (score = 2) did not show any invasive recurrence over the duration of follow-up (4-208 mo), and 89% of such patients are estimated to remain free of invasive recurrence, even after 15 y. Thus, determination of stromal Cav-1 levels may be a useful new biomarker for guiding the treatment of ER(+) DCIS patients.","author":[{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Katherine H"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengbao"},{"family":"Kovatich","given":"Albert J"},{"family":"Schwartz","given":"Gordon F"},{"family":"Pestell","given":"Richard G"},{"family":"Sotgia","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Rui","given":"Hallgeir"},{"family":"Lisanti","given":"Michael P"}],"citation-key":"Witkiewicz2009b","container-title":"Cancer Biology & Therapy","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1538-4047 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6]]},"page":"1071-9","PMID":"19502809","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Stromal caveolin-1 levels predict early DCIS progression to invasive breast cancer.","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

In contrast, in a parallel analysis, the levels of tumor epithelial Cav-1 had no prognostic significance. As such, the prognostic value of Cav-1 immunostaining in TN breast cancer patients is compartment-specific, and selective for an absence of Cav-1 staining in the stromal fibroblast compartment. A recursive-partitioning algorithm was used to assess which factors are most predictive of overall survival in TN breast cancer patients. In this analysis, we included tumor size, histologic grade, whether the patient received surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, CK5/6, EGFR, p53 and Ki67 status, as well as the stromal Cav-1 score. This analysis indicated that stromal loss of Cav-1 expression was the most important prognostic factor for overall survival in TN breast cancer. Virtually identical results were obtained with CK5/6 (+) and/or EGFR (+) TN breast cancer cases, demonstrating that a loss of stromal Cav-1 is also a strong prognostic factor for basal-like breast cancers. Our current findings may have important implications for the close monitoring and treatment stratification of TN and basal-like breast cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Witkiewicz","given":"Agnieszka K"},{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"Abhijit"},{"family":"Sammons","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Er","given":"Ozlem"},{"family":"Potoczek","given":"Magdalena B"},{"family":"Guiles","given":"Fran"},{"family":"Sotgia","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Brody","given":"Jonathan R"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Edith P"},{"family":"Lisanti","given":"Michael P"}],"citation-key":"Witkiewicz2010","container-title":"Cancer Biology & Therapy","event-place":"United States","ISSN":"1538-4047 (Linking)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"page":"135-43","PMID":"20431349","publisher-place":"United States","title":"Loss of stromal caveolin-1 expression predicts poor clinical outcome in triple negative and basal-like breast cancers.","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},

In this dissertation, we propose three statistical methodologies: one is develop a metric using Bayesian decision theoretic framework; the second is propose a sample size estimation method (SWIRL); and the third is develop a reproducibility metric .A metric which measures the decrease in the expected event rate as a result of predictive biomarker guided therapy is proposed using Bayesian decision theoretic framework for a count clinical end point. Since Phase II data are usually small, maximum likelihood based estimates are biased and inefficient. This new metric, which also incorporates clinician inputs in the form of a prior however, is informative in making a go-no-go decision and the study design to choose for Phase III studies. Using toy simulation and a simulation conducted to mimic asthma clinical trial study, we show the robustness of the method under different scenarios.Sample size estimation methods that match the study design and the metric under consideration are key in predictive biomarker clinical utility evaluation process. In this dissertation we propose a sample size estimation method, Squared Width Inversion Regression Line (SWIRL). The SWIRL method is used to estimate a sample size n such that the 95% confidence interval width of the metric under consideration is smaller than a user defined length (Wtarg). This is the first sample size method developed for estimating this target predictive parameter.During assay development and validation processes, an original clinically validated assay is required to be modified for a number of different reasons. However, such medication invalidates the previous biomarker-outcome association studies and would force researcher to re-run the previous studies under the modified biomarker. This is time consuming and expensive. Here, we propose a reproducibility metric _r which measures the impact of assay modification on patient outcome. A combination of both novel equations and simulations were used to estimate _r and the associated 95% confidence interval.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Woldu","given":"Henok"}],"citation-key":"woldu_2018","event-place":"Athens, GA","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"University of Georgia","publisher-place":"Athens, GA","title":"Developing study design and analysis methods for evaluating predictive biomarker clinical utility and reproducibility","title-short":"Developing study design and analysis methods for evaluating predictive biomarker clinical utility and reproducibility","type":"thesis","URL":"https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/woldu_henok_g_201808_phd.pdf"},

  {"id":"wrightmuelasRoleRobustnessGini2019","abstract":"We recently introduced the Gini coefficient (GC) for assessing the expression variation of a particular gene in a dataset, as a means of selecting improved reference genes over the cohort (‘housekeeping genes’) typically used for normalisation in expression profiling studies. Those genes (transcripts) that we determined to be useable as reference genes differed greatly from previous suggestions based on hypothesis-driven approaches. A limitation of this initial study is that a single (albeit large) dataset was employed for both tissues and cell lines. We here extend this analysis to encompass seven other large datasets. Although their absolute values differ a little, the Gini values and median expression levels of the various genes are well correlated with each other between the various cell line datasets, implying that our original choice of the more ubiquitously expressed low-Gini-coefficient genes was indeed sound. In tissues, the Gini values and median expression levels of genes showed a greater variation, with the GC of genes changing with the number and types of tissues in the data sets. In all data sets, regardless of whether this was derived from tissues or cell lines, we also show that the GC is a robust measure of gene expression stability. Using the GC as a measure of expression stability we illustrate its utility to find tissue- and cell line-optimised housekeeping genes without any prior bias, that again include only a small number of previously reported housekeeping genes. We also independently confirmed this experimentally using RT-qPCR with 40 candidate GC genes in a panel of 10 cell lines. These were termed the Gini Genes. In many cases, the variation in the expression levels of classical reference genes is really quite huge (e.g. 44 fold for GAPDH in one data set), suggesting that the cure (of using them as normalising genes) may in some cases be worse than the disease (of not doing so). We recommend the present data-driven approach for the selection of reference genes by using the easy-to-calculate and robust GC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wright Muelas","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Mughal","given":"Farah"},{"family":"O’Hagan","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Day","given":"Philip J."},{"family":"Kell","given":"Douglas B."}],"citation-key":"wrightmuelasRoleRobustnessGini2019","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-019-54288-7","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,29]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-21","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The role and robustness of the Gini coefficient as an unbiased tool for the selection of Gini genes for normalising expression profiling data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54288-7","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"wrightUnbiasedSplitVariable2017","abstract":"The most popular approach for analyzing survival data is the Cox regression model. The Cox model may, however, be misspecified, and its proportionality assumption may not always be fulfilled. An alternative approach for survival prediction is random forests for survival outcomes. The standard split criterion for random survival forests is the log-rank test statistic, which favors splitting variables with many possible split points. Conditional inference forests avoid this split variable selection bias. However, linear rank statistics are utilized by default in conditional inference forests to select the optimal splitting variable, which cannot detect non-linear effects in the independent variables. An alternative is to use maximally selected rank statistics for the split point selection. As in conditional inference forests, splitting variables are compared on the p-value scale. However, instead of the conditional Monte-Carlo approach used in conditional inference forests, p-value approximations are employed. We describe several p-value approximations and the implementation of the proposed random forest approach. A simulation study demonstrates that unbiased split variable selection is possible. However, there is a trade-off between unbiased split variable selection and runtime. In benchmark studies of prediction performance on simulated and real datasets, the new method performs better than random survival forests if informative dichotomous variables are combined with uninformative variables with more categories and better than conditional inference forests if non-linear covariate effects are included. In a runtime comparison, the method proves to be computationally faster than both alternatives, if a simple p-value approximation is used.

  {"id":"wu_2022","abstract":"Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is an aggressive disease requiring active management. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC) is considered the standard treatment paradigm for MIBC patients, which could result in significant perioperative mortality and morbidity, as well as the significant alteration of the quality of life (QOL). Notably, multimodal bladder-preserving treatment strategies have been recommended for highly selected patients. Pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC is a powerful prognostic indicator of survival for patients with MIBC. Clinical complete response (cCR) is then introduced as a complementary endpoint for pCR to assess disease status preoperatively. Bladder preservation strategy for patients who achieve cCR following NAC is emerging as a new treatment concept. However, the efficiency of the conservative strategy remains controversial. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of cCR and the feasibility and safety of bladder preservation strategy in highly selected MIBC patients who achieve cCR following NAC. We conclude that a conservative strategy can be considered a reasonable alternative to RC in carefully selected cCR MIBC patients, leading to acceptable oncological outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Rui-Yang"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Chuan-Zhen"},{"family":"Shang","given":"Bing-Qing"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Hong-Zhe"},{"family":"Shou","given":"Jian-Zhong"}],"citation-key":"wu_2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.816444","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"816444","PMCID":"PMC9043546","PMID":"35494010","source":"PubMed","title":"Disease Management of Clinical Complete Responders to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: A Review of Literature","title-short":"Disease Management of Clinical Complete Responders to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

We validated snRNA-seq on ﬁbrotic kidney from mice 14 days after unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery.\nResults A total of 11,391 transcriptomes were generated in the comparison phase. We identiﬁed ten clusters in the scRNA-seq dataset, but glomerular cell types were absent, and one cluster consisted primarily of artifactual dissociation–induced stress response genes. By contrast, snRNA-seq from all three platforms captured a diversity of kidney cell types that were not represented in the scRNA-seq dataset, including glomerular podocytes, mesangial cells, and endothelial cells. No stress response genes were detected. Our snRNA-seq protocol yielded 20-fold more podocytes compared with published scRNA-seq datasets (2.4% versus 0.12%, respectively). Unexpectedly, single-cell and single-nucleus platforms had equivalent gene detection sensitivity. For validation, analysis of frozen day 14 UUO kidney revealed rare juxtaglomerular cells, novel activated proximal tubule and ﬁbroblast cell states, and previously unidentiﬁed tubulointerstitial signaling pathways.\nConclusions snRNA-seq achieves comparable gene detection to scRNA-seq in adult kidney, and it also has substantial advantages, including reduced dissociation bias, compatibility with frozen samples, elimination of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and successful performance on inﬂamed ﬁbrotic kidney.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Haojia"},{"family":"Kirita","given":"Yuhei"},{"family":"Donnelly","given":"Erinn L."},{"family":"Humphreys","given":"Benjamin D."}],"citation-key":"wuAdvantagesSingleNucleusSingleCell2019","container-title":"Journal of the American Society of Nephrology","container-title-short":"JASN","DOI":"10.1681/ASN.2018090912","ISSN":"1046-6673, 1533-3450","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","page":"23-32","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Advantages of Single-Nucleus over Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Adult Kidney: Rare Cell Types and Novel Cell States Revealed in Fibrosis","title-short":"Advantages of Single-Nucleus over Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of Adult Kidney","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://jasn.asnjournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1681/ASN.2018090912","volume":"30"},

Mutation data, gene expression profiles and clinical data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Patients were divided into high and low TMB groups, allowing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to be identified. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis were used to identify the functions of the DEGs. And immune cell infiltration signatures were evaluated by CIBERSORT algorithm. These results shown that high TMB was significantly associated with prognosis. We obtained a list of TMB related genes which may influence the infiltrations of immune cells. We also found a higher proportion of CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells and NK cells in the high TMB group. Our data suggest that higher TMB tends to promote the infiltrations of T cells and NK cells and patients with higher TMB may achieve a more favorable prognosis in bladder cancer.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Zonglong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Muru"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qinggang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yaxiao"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Kejia"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lipeng"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Hongda"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Benkang"}],"citation-key":"wuIdentificationGeneExpression2020","container-title":"International Journal of Medical Sciences","container-title-short":"Int J Med Sci","DOI":"10.7150/ijms.39056","ISSN":"1449-1907","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","number":"1","page":"89-96","PMCID":"PMC6945555","PMID":"31929742","source":"PubMed","title":"Identification of gene expression profiles and immune cell infiltration signatures between low and high tumor mutation burden groups in bladder cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"wuNewBayesianJoint2019","abstract":"In longitudinal clinical trials, it is common that subjects may permanently withdraw from the study (dropout), or return to the study after missing one or more visits (intermittent missingness). It is also routinely encountered in HIV prevention clinical trials that there is a large proportion of zeros in count response data. In this paper, a sequential multinomial model is adopted for dropout and subsequently a conditional model is constructed for intermittent missingness. The new model captures the complex structure of missingness and incorporates dropout and intermittent missingness simultaneously. The model also allows us to easily compute the predictive probabilities of different missing data patterns. A zero-inflated Poisson mixed-effects regression model is assumed for the longitudinal count response data. We also propose an approach to assess the overall treatment effects under the zero-inflated Poisson model. We further show that the joint posterior distribution is improper if uniform priors are specified for the regression coefficients under the proposed model. Variations of the g-prior, Jeffreys prior, and maximally dispersed normal prior are thus established as remedies for the improper posterior distribution. An efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed using a hierarchical centering technique. A modified logarithm of the pseudomarginal likelihood and a concordance based area under the curve criterion are used to compare the models under different missing data mechanisms. We then conduct an extensive simulation study to investigate the empirical performance of the proposed methods and further illustrate the methods using real data from an HIV prevention clinical trial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ming-Hui"},{"family":"Schifano","given":"Elizabeth D."},{"family":"Ibrahim","given":"Joseph G."},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Jeffrey D."}],"citation-key":"wuNewBayesianJoint2019","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8379","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","page":"5565-5586","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A new Bayesian joint model for longitudinal count data with many zeros, intermittent missingness, and dropout with applications to HIV prevention trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8379","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"wuSplineAnalysisBiomarker2022","abstract":"Simple Summary\nThis paper presents methods to pool continuous biomarker measurements from multiple studies to estimate the dose–response curves that allow for the nonlinear association between biomarker values and disease risks in matched/nested case–control studies. The approach can be easily applied to pooling projects of cancer studies and user-friendly software for implementing the method can be found on the corresponding author’s website.\n\nAbstract\nPooling biomarker data across multiple studies enables researchers to obtain precise estimates of the association between biomarker measurements and disease risks due to increased sample sizes. However, biomarker measurements often vary significantly across different assays and laboratories; therefore, calibration of the local laboratory measurements to a reference laboratory is necessary before pooling data. We propose two methods for estimating the dose–response curves that allow for a nonlinear association between the continuous biomarker measurements and log relative risk in pooling projects of matched/nested case–control studies. Our methods are based on full calibration and internalized calibration methods. The full calibration method uses calibrated biomarker measurements for all subjects, even for people with reference laboratory measurements, while the internalized calibration method uses the reference laboratory measurements when available and otherwise uses the calibrated biomarker measurements. We conducted simulation studies to compare these methods, as well as a naive method, where data are pooled without calibration. Our simulation and theoretical results suggest that, in estimating the dose–response curves for biomarker-disease relationships, the internalized and full calibration methods perform substantially better than the naive method, and the full calibration approach is the preferred method for calibrating biomarker measurements. We apply our methods in a pooling project of nested case–control studies to estimate the association of circulating Vitamin D levels with risk of colorectal cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yujie"},{"family":"Gail","given":"Mitchell"},{"family":"Smith-Warner","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Ziegler","given":"Regina"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Molin"}],"citation-key":"wuSplineAnalysisBiomarker2022","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14112783","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,3]]},"page":"2783","PMCID":"PMC9179317","PMID":"35681763","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Spline Analysis of Biomarker Data Pooled from Multiple Matched/Nested Case–Control Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9179317/","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"wyss_2020","abstract":"Estimating hazard ratios (HR) presents challenges for propensity score (PS)-based analyses of cohorts with differential depletion of susceptibles. When the treatment effect is not null, cohorts that were balanced at baseline tend to become unbalanced on baseline characteristics over time as \"susceptible\" individuals drop out of the population at risk differentially across treatment groups due to having outcome events. This imbalance in baseline covariates causes marginal (population-averaged) HRs to diverge from conditional (covariate-adjusted) HRs over time and systematically move toward the null. Methods that condition on a baseline PS yield HR estimates that fall between the marginal and conditional HRs when these diverge. Unconditional methods that match on the PS or weight by a function of the PS can estimate the marginal HR consistently but are prone to misinterpretation when the marginal HR diverges toward the null. Here, we present results from a series of simulations to help analysts gain insight on these issues. We propose a novel approach that uses time-dependent PSs to consistently estimate conditional HRs, regardless of whether susceptibles have been depleted differentially. Simulations show that adjustment for time-dependent PSs can adjust for covariate imbalances over time that are caused by depletion of susceptibles. Updating the PS is unnecessary when outcome incidence is so low that depletion of susceptibles is negligible. But if incidence is high, and covariates and treatment affect risk, then covariate imbalances arise as susceptibles are depleted, and PS-based methods can consistently estimate the conditional HR only if the PS is periodically updated.","author":[{"family":"Wyss","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Gagne","given":"Joshua J."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yueqin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Esther H."},{"family":"Major","given":"Jacqueline M."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shirley V."},{"family":"Desai","given":"Rishi J."},{"family":"Franklin","given":"Jessica M."},{"family":"Schneeweiss","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Toh","given":"Sengwee"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Fireman","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"wyss_2020","container-title":"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)","container-title-short":"Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1097/EDE.0000000000001107","ISSN":"1531-5487","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"82-89","PMID":"31569120","source":"PubMed","title":"Use of Time-Dependent Propensity Scores to Adjust Hazard Ratio Estimates in Cohort Studies with Differential Depletion of Susceptibles","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},

These algorithms can use censored data for modeling, such as support vector machines for survival analysis and random survival forest (RSF). However, it is still debated whether traditional (Cox proportional hazard regression) or machine learning-based prognostic models have better predictive performance.\n\nObjective\nThis study aimed to compare the performance of breast cancer prognostic prediction models based on machine learning and Cox regression.\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective cohort study included all patients diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently hospitalized in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016. After all exclusions, a total of 22,176 cases with 21 features were eligible for model development. The data set was randomly split into a training set (15,523 cases, 70%) and a test set (6653 cases, 30%) for developing 4 models and predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. The discriminative ability of models was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index), the time-dependent area under the curve, and D-index; the calibration ability of models was evaluated by the Brier score.\n\nResults\nThe RSF model revealed the best discriminative performance among the 4 models with 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year time-dependent area under the curve of 0.857, 0.838, and 0.781, a D-index of 7.643 (95% CI 6.542, 8.930) and a C-index of 0.827 (95% CI 0.809, 0.845). The statistical difference of the C-index was tested, and the RSF model significantly outperformed the Cox-EN (elastic net) model (C-index 0.816, 95% CI 0.796, 0.836; P=.01), the Cox model (C-index 0.814, 95% CI 0.794, 0.835; P=.003), and the support vector machine model (C-index 0.812, 95% CI 0.793, 0.832; P<.001). The 4 models’ 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year Brier scores were very close, ranging from 0.027 to 0.094 and less than 0.1, which meant all models had good calibration. In the context of feature importance, elastic net and RSF both indicated that TNM staging, neoadjuvant therapy, number of lymph node metastases, age, and tumor diameter were the top 5 important features for predicting the prognosis of breast cancer. A final online tool was developed to predict the overall survival of patients with breast cancer.\n\nConclusions\nThe RSF model slightly outperformed the other models on discriminative ability, revealing the potential of the RSF method as an effective approach to building prognostic prediction models in the context of survival analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jialong"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zezhou"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Changming"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Jing"},{"family":"He","given":"Yulian"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Ying"}],"citation-key":"xiaoApplicationComparisonMachine2022","container-title":"JMIR Medical Informatics","container-title-short":"JMIR Med Inform","DOI":"10.2196/33440","ISSN":"2291-9694","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,18]]},"page":"e33440","PMCID":"PMC8900909","PMID":"35179504","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Application and Comparison of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Breast Cancer Prognosis: Retrospective Cohort Study","title-short":"The Application and Comparison of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Breast Cancer Prognosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8900909/","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"xieAutoScoreSurvivalDevelopingInterpretable2022","abstract":"Background\nScoring systems are highly interpretable and widely used to evaluate time-to-event outcomes in healthcare research. However, existing time-to-event scores are predominantly created ad-hoc using a few manually selected variables based on clinician's knowledge, suggesting an unmet need for a robust and efficient generic score-generating method.\nMethods\nAutoScore was previously developed as an interpretable machine learning score generator, integrating both machine learning and point-based scores in the strong discriminability and accessibility. We have further extended it to the time-to-event outcomes and developed AutoScore-Survival, for generating time-to-event scores with right-censored survival data. Random survival forest provided an efficient solution for selecting variables, and Cox regression was used for score weighting. We implemented our proposed method as an R package. We illustrated our method in a study of 90-day survival prediction for patients in intensive care units and compared its performance with other survival models, the random survival forest, and two traditional clinical scores.\nResults\nThe AutoScore-Survival-derived scoring system was more parsimonious than survival models built using traditional variable selection methods (e.g., penalized likelihood approach and stepwise variable selection), and its performance was comparable to survival models using the same set of variables. Although AutoScore-Survival achieved a comparable integrated area under the curve of 0.782 (95% CI: 0.767–0.794), the integer-valued time-to-event scores generated are favorable in clinical applications because they are easier to compute and interpret.\nConclusions\nOur proposed AutoScore-Survival provides a robust and easy-to-use machine learning-based clinical score generator to studies of time-to-event outcomes.

  {"id":"xuPredictionTumorMutation2018","abstract":"Objective: Cancer immunoediting is the process of eliminating highly immunogenic tumor cells by somatic evolution and protecting the host from tumor development in the host immune system. Frequencies of somatic mutations or tumor mutation burden (TMB) were associated with immunogenicity of breast cancer. This study aimed to predict the level of TMB in patients with breast cancer by the expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), HER-2, and Ki-67, thereby anticipating the prognosis of patients and the possible response to immunotherapy.\nPatients and methods: In 53 patients with breast cancer, the 453 multigenes panel based on NGS was used to determine the TMB value of breast cancer in the patient's primary tumor tissues. The predicted TMB value was divided into 4 groups: A (0-3.33), B (3.33-5.56), C (5.56-8.89), and D (>8.89), according to the quartile method, with group A as reference level. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk ratio of each molecule type, and the prediction model was established. Survival probabilities by covariates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimator survival analysis and Cox's proportional hazards models.\nResults: In 53 patients, the TMB value measured by the NGS polygenic panel was between 0 and 14.4/Mb. TMB distribution in 53 cases of breast cancer tissue: 18 cases in A group, 22 cases in B group, 10 cases in C group, and 3 cases in D group. HER-2 expression positivity was significantly associated with TMB (HER-2 positive vs HER-2 negative, odds ratio [OR] =34.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.711-821.689, P=0.0065). Higher TMB was distributed in the patients who were Ki-67 expression positive (>14%) than those who were Ki-67 expression negative (≤14%) (OR =0.217, 95% CI: 0.054-0.806, P=0.0242). However, no significant differences of TMB were found between ER-positive group and ER-negative group (OR =3.133, 95% CI: 0.124-127.687, P=0.4954) and between PR-positive group and PR-negative group in terms of TMB (OR =1.702, 95% CI: 0.162-20.335, P=0.6492). The predicted model is TMB = -1.14×ER +0.53×PR +3.55×HER-2-1.53×Ki-67+ CONSTANT (INTERCEPT). Patients with low TMB had a better disease-free survival (DFS) than those with high TMB (83 vs 59 m, P=0.002). In a multivariate analysis, high TMB (>5.56) was an independent predictive factor for decreased DFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 5.594; 95% CI: 1.694-18.473; P = 0.005).\nConclusion: The preliminary results suggest that the level of TMB value in patients with breast cancer can be predicted based on the expression levels of ER, PR, HER-2, and Ki-67, which may indicate the prognostic and predictive value of immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Junnan"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiangyu"},{"family":"Jing","given":"Mingxi"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Tao"}],"citation-key":"xuPredictionTumorMutation2018","container-title":"OncoTargets and Therapy","container-title-short":"Onco Targets Ther","DOI":"10.2147/OTT.S159830","ISSN":"1178-6930","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","page":"2269-2275","PMCID":"PMC5914885","PMID":"29719409","source":"PubMed","title":"Prediction of tumor mutation burden in breast cancer based on the expression of ER, PR, HER-2, and Ki-67","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression.

  {"id":"yamadaFeatureSelectionUsing","abstract":"Feature selection problems have been extensively studied in the setting of linear estimation (e.g. LASSO), but less emphasis has been placed on feature selection for non-linear functions. In this study, we propose a method for feature selection in neural network estimation problems. The new procedure is based on probabilistic relaxation of the 0 norm of features, or the count of the number of selected features. Our 0-based regularization relies on a continuous relaxation of the Bernoulli distribution; such relaxation allows our model to learn the parameters of the approximate Bernoulli distributions via gradient descent. The proposed framework simultaneously learns either a nonlinear regression or classiﬁcation function while selecting a small subset of features. We provide an information-theoretic justiﬁcation for incorporating Bernoulli distribution into feature selection. Furthermore, we evaluate our method using synthetic and real-life data to demonstrate that our approach outperforms other commonly used methods in both predictive performance and feature selection.","author":[{"family":"Yamada","given":"Yutaro"},{"family":"Lindenbaum","given":"Ofir"},{"family":"Negahban","given":"Sahand"},{"family":"Kluger","given":"Yuval"}],"citation-key":"yamadaFeatureSelectionUsing","language":"en","page":"12","source":"Zotero","title":"Feature Selection using Stochastic Gates","type":"article-journal"},

In this research, we conducted extensive simulation studies to compare the performance of various feature selection methods, with a particular focus on the impact of Bayesian optimization on those where hyper-parameters tuning is needed. We further utilized the gene expression data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to predict various brain imaging-related phenotypes, where various feature selection methods were employed to mine the data. We found through simulation studies that feature selection methods with hyper-parameters tuned using Bayesian optimization often yield better recall rates, and the analysis of transcriptomic data further revealed that Bayesian optimization-guided feature selection can improve the accuracy of disease risk prediction models. In conclusion, Bayesian optimization can facilitate feature selection methods when hyper-parameter tuning is needed and has the potential to substantially benefit downstream tasks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Kaixin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Long"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yalu"}],"citation-key":"yang_2024","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-024-54515-w","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,17]]},"language":"en","license":"2024 The Author(s)","page":"1-11","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The impact of Bayesian optimization on feature selection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54515-w","volume":"14"},

In binary classification, for example, when only a subset of positive instances is labeled whereas the remaining are unlabeled, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is required to model from both positive and unlabeled data. Similarly, when class labels are corrupted by mislabeled instances, methods are needed for learning in the presence of class label noise (LN). Here we propose adaptive sampling (AdaSampling), a framework for both PU learning and learning with class LN. By iteratively estimating the class mislabeling probability with an adaptive sampling procedure, the proposed method progressively reduces the risk of selecting mislabeled instances for model training and subsequently constructs highly generalizable models even when a large proportion of mislabeled instances is present in the data. We demonstrate the utilities of proposed methods using simulation and benchmark data, and compare them to alternative approaches that are commonly used for PU learning and/or learning with LN. We then introduce two novel bioinformatics applications where AdaSampling is used to: 1) identify kinase-substrates from mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data and 2) predict transcription factor target genes by integrating various next-generation sequencing data.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Pengyi"},{"family":"Ormerod","given":"John T."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Chendong"},{"family":"Zomaya","given":"Albert Y."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jean Y.

Linear dimensionality reduction methods, especially principal-component analysis (PCA), are widely used in detecting sample-to-sample heterogeneity, while recently developed non-linear methods, such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), can efficiently cluster heterogeneous samples in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Yet, the application of t-SNE and UMAP in bulk transcriptomic analysis and comparison with conventional methods have not been achieved. We compare four major dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, multidimensional scaling [MDS], t-SNE, and UMAP) in analyzing 71 large bulk transcriptomic datasets. UMAP is superior to PCA and MDS but shows some advantages over t-SNE in differentiating batch effects, identifying pre-defined biological groups, and revealing in-depth clusters in two-dimensional space.

However, current application methods using stem cells are underdeveloped, as these cells are used directly regardless of their culture medium and subgroup.

By combining machine learning methods (such as deep learning) with data sets obtained through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, we can discover the hidden structure of these cells, predict their effects more accurately, and effectively use subpopulations with differentiation potential for stem cell therapy. scRNA-seq technology has changed the study of transcription, because it can express single-cell genes with single-cell anatomical resolution. However, this powerful technology is sensitive to biological and technical noise. The subsequent data analysis can be computationally difficult for a variety of reasons, such as denoising single cell data, reducing dimensionality, imputing missing values, and accounting for the zero-inflated nature.

In this article, we propose a survival forest method for interval-censored data based on the conditional inference framework. We describe how this framework can be adapted to the situation of interval-censored data. We show that the tuning parameters have a non-negligible effect on the survival forest performance and guidance is provided on how to tune the parameters in a data-dependent way to improve the overall performance of the method. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the proposed survival forest is at least as effective as a survival tree method when the underlying model has a tree structure, performs similarly to an interval-censored Cox proportional hazards model fit when the true relationship is linear, and outperforms the survival tree method and Cox model when the true relationship is nonlinear.

Our classifier achieved an average F1 score of 96.1% on held-out GTEx samples. Using SHAP values, we identified the 2423 most discriminatory genes, of which 98.6% were also identified by differential expression analysis across all tissues.

We first show that HDLSS datasets have different geometric representations depending on whether a ρ-mixing-type dependency appears in variables or not. When the ρ-mixing-type dependency appears in variables, the HDLSS data converge to an n-dimensional surface of unit sphere with increasing dimension. We pay special attention to this phenomenon. We propose a method called the noise-reduction methodology to estimate eigenvalues of a HDLSS dataset. We show that the eigenvalue estimator holds consistency properties along with its limiting distribution in HDLSS context. We consider consistency properties of PC directions. We apply the noise-reduction methodology to estimating PC scores. We also give an application in the discriminant analysis for HDLSS datasets by using the inverse covariance matrix estimator induced by the noise-reduction methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Yata","given":"Kazuyoshi"},{"family":"Aoshima","given":"Makoto"}],"citation-key":"yata_2012","container-title":"Journal of Multivariate Analysis","container-title-short":"Journal of Multivariate Analysis","DOI":"10.1016/j.jmva.2011.09.002","ISSN":"0047-259X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,1]]},"page":"193-215","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effective PCA for high-dimension, low-sample-size data with noise reduction via geometric representations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X11001904","volume":"105"},

However, a natural question is how to determine the biomarker cutoff that distinguishes biomarker-positive patients from the negatives, and then evaluate the efficacy of the new therapeutics in one trial. We propose a Phase II basket biomarker cutoff (BBC) design where a biomarker for identifying the sensitive patients is measured on a continuous scale. The proposed BBC design incorporates the biomarker cutoff identification procedure into a basket trial via Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We verify its feasibility and practicability via real trial examples, extensive simulation studies, and sensitivity analyses. The simulation studies show that the BBC design can select biomarker-positive patients accurately and may exhibit competitive improvement in regards to the overall Type I error, power, and average sample number.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Guosheng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Odani","given":"Motoi"},{"family":"Fukimbara","given":"Satoru"}],"citation-key":"yinBayesianHierarchicalModeling2021","container-title":"Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research","DOI":"10.1080/19466315.2020.1811146","ISSN":"null","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,3]]},"page":"248-258","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling and Biomarker Cutoff Identification in Basket Trials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2020.1811146","volume":"13"},

In this paper, we demonstrate how deep learning and Bayesian optimization methods that have been remarkably successful in general high-dimensional prediction tasks can be adapted to the problem of predicting cancer outcomes. We perform an extensive comparison of Bayesian optimized deep survival models and other state of the art machine learning methods for survival analysis, and describe a framework for interpreting deep survival models using a risk backpropagation technique. Finally, we illustrate that deep survival models can successfully transfer information across diseases to improve prognostic accuracy.

We first selected single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and genes associated with breast cancer prognosis in the training set to construct the prognostic prediction model, and then replicated the prediction efficiency in the validation set.\nRESULTS: Four SNPs and three genes associated with the prognosis of breast cancer in the training set were included in the prognostic model. Patients were divided into the high-risk group and low-risk group based on the four SNPs and three genes signature-based genetic prognostic index. High-risk patients showed a significant worse overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR) 9.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.81-23.33, P < 0.001] than the low-risk group. Compared to the model constructed with only gene expression, the C statistics for the signature-based genetic prognostic index [area under curves (AUC) = 0.79, 95% CI 0.72-0.86] showed a significant increase (P < 0.001). Additionally, we further replicated the prognostic prediction model in the validation set as patients in the high-risk group also showed a significantly worse overall survival (HR 4.55, 95% CI 1.50-13.88, P < 0.001), and the C statistics for the signature-based genetic prognostic index was 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.86). The following time-dependent ROC revealed that the mean of AUCs were 0.839 and 0.748 in the training set and the validation set, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that integrating genomic and transcriptomic profiles could greatly improve the predictive efficiency of the prognosis of breast cancer patients.","author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Chengxiao"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Na"},{"family":"Pu","given":"Zhening"},{"family":"Song","given":"Ci"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jiaping"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Juncheng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Hongxia"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yue"}],"citation-key":"yuIntegratingGenomicTranscriptomic2019","container-title":"Breast Cancer Research and Treatment","container-title-short":"Breast Cancer Res.

  {"id":"yun:2019","abstract":"Background\nThe International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer introduced the 8th edition of the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer. In this study, we validated the 8th edition of the TNM staging system and compared its discrimination power with that of the previous 7th edition.\n\nMethods\nA retrospective analysis was carried out on patients who underwent complete resection with systematic lymph node dissection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) between 2006 and 2015 at a tertiary referral center in Seoul, South Korea. Cox regression model was used to identify significant differences between adjacent TNM stage groupings. The Concordance index (C-index), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and R2 measure were utilized to evaluate the discrimination ability of the staging systems.\n\nResults\nA total of 3,950 patients (2,440 male, median age: 63 years) were analyzed. Median follow-up was 59 months (interquartile ranges, 38–88 months). According to the 8th edition, survival curves of overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) within adjacent stage groupings showed significant differences except for IIA vs. IIB. Compared with the 7th edition, the 8th edition showed higher C-index (0.753 vs. 0.751), lower AIC (17,517 vs. 17,543), and higher R2 (0.178 vs. 0.171) values, indicating better discrimination ability.\n\nConclusions\nStratification based on the 8th edition of the TNM staging system showed favorable prognostic validity compared with the 7th edition. The 8th edition also had superior discrimination ability in terms of OS and RFS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Yun","given":"Jae Kwang"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Geun Dong"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyeong Ryul"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yong-Hee"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong Kwan"},{"family":"Park","given":"Seung-Il"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Sehoon"}],"citation-key":"yun:2019","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","container-title-short":"J Thorac Dis","DOI":"10.21037/jtd.2019.07.43","ISSN":"2072-1439","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7]]},"page":"2955-2964","PMCID":"PMC6687999","PMID":"31463125","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Validation of the 8th edition of the TNM staging system in 3,950 patients with surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6687999/","volume":"11"},

In these models, the likelihood-based methods (such as expectation-maximization algorithm and Newton-Raphson) are used for estimating the parameters, but in the presence of contaminations, these methods are unstable. To overcome this challenge, we extend the M-estimator methods and propose a robust estimator approach to obtain a robust estimation of the regression parameters in the joint model. Our proposed algorithm has two steps (Expectation and Solution). In the expectation step, the likelihood function is expected by conditioning on the observed data and in the solution step, the parameters are computed, with solving robust estimating equations. Therefore, this algorithm achieves robustness by applying robust estimating equations and weighted likelihood in the S-step. Simulation studies under various situations of contaminations show that the robust algorithm gives us consistent estimates with a smaller bias than likelihood-based methods. The application section uses data on factors affecting fertility and birth spacing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zandkarimi","given":"Eghbal"},{"family":"Moghimbeigi","given":"Abbas"},{"family":"Mahjub","given":"Hossein"}],"citation-key":"zandkarimiRobustInferenceJoint","container-title":"Statistics in Medicine","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8811","ISSN":"1097-0258","issue":"n/a","language":"en","license":"© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Robust inference in the joint modeling of multilevel zero-inflated Poisson and Cox models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8811","volume":"n/a"},
  {"id":"zaslavsky:2010","abstract":"Abstract \n            Bayesian methods are often used to reduce the sample sizes and/or increase the power of clinical trials. The right choice of the prior distribution is a critical step in Bayesian modeling. If the prior not completely specified, historical data may be used to estimate it. In the empirical Bayesian analysis, the resulting prior can be used to produce the posterior distribution. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian Poisson model with a conjugate Gamma prior. The parameters of Gamma distribution are estimated in the empirical Bayesian framework under two estimation schemes. The straightforward numerical search for the maximum likelihood (ML) solution using the marginal negative binomial distribution is unfeasible occasionally. We propose a simplification to the maximization procedure. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to create a set of Poisson parameters from the historical count data. These Poisson parameters are used to uniquely define the Gamma likelihood function. Easily computable approximation formulae may be used to find the ML estimations for the parameters of gamma distribution. For the sample size calculations, the ML solution is replaced by its upper confidence limit to reflect an incomplete exchangeability of historical trials as opposed to current studies. The exchangeability is measured by the confidence interval for the historical rate of the events. With this prior, the formula for the sample size calculation is completely defined.

A series of uniformly and multiscale analyses for each sample were performed, including accurate cell type annotation, functional gene expressions, cell interaction network, survival analysis and etc. Plus, we visualized CancerSCEM as a user-friendly web interface for users to browse, search, online analyze and download all the metadata as well as analytical results. More importantly and unprecedentedly, the newly-constructed comprehensive online analyzing platform in CancerSCEM integrates seven analyze functions, where investigators can interactively perform cancer scRNA-seq analyses.

After incorporating the prior information of the treatment effects, the Bayesian sample size is the number of patients of the Phase III trial for a given Bayesian Predictive Power (BPP) or Bayesian Historical Predictive Power (BHPP). After that, the numerical simulations are carried out to determine the Bayesian sample size for the Phase III clinical trial. In particular, there exists a hook phenomenon for the BHPP when the number of patients of the Phase II trial equals 70 assuming the normal, uniform, or truncated normal treatment effect. Moreover, we add some sensitivity analysis of the Bayesian sample size about the parameters in the simulations.

When using random forests to predict a quantitative response, an important but often overlooked challenge is the determination of prediction intervals that will contain an unobserved response value with a specified probability. We propose new random forest prediction intervals that are based on the empirical distribution of out-of-bag prediction errors. These intervals can be obtained as a by-product of a single random forest. Under regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed intervals have asymptotically correct coverage rates. Simulation studies and analysis of 60 real datasets are used to compare the finite-sample properties of the proposed intervals with quantile regression forests and recently proposed split conformal intervals.

Firstly, the fuzzy relation matrix is established by Laplacian kernel. Secondly, the approximately equal relation on fuzzy sets is defined. And then, the approximate conditional entropy based on fuzzy information granule and the importance of internal attributes are defined. Approximate conditional entropy can measure the uncertainty of knowledge from two different perspectives of information and algebra theory.

Our results, composed of responses from medical professionals, professional data scientists, and tenure-track faculty, show that the prevalent form of visualizing only inferential uncertainty can lead to significant overestimates of treatment effects, even among highly trained experts.

With assumption that these differences and mean differences (bias) follow a normal distribution, limits of agreement of differences and confidence interval of bias are used to represent agreement of two methods.\nResults: Limits of agreement of difference range from -0.044 to 0.0615, while confidence intervals for the bias range from 0.0026 to 0.0145, which does not include zero, resulting in estimated treatment effect differs for two methods.\nConclusion: In general, bias caused by interval censoring in treatment effect exists with large sample studies.

Compared to using survival data alone, the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data allows for estimation of direct and indirect treatment effects, thereby resulting in improved efficacy assessment. Although global fit indices such as AIC or BIC can be used to rank joint models, these measures do not provide separate assessments of each component of the joint model. In this paper, we develop a novel decomposition of AIC and BIC (i.e., AIC = AICLong+ AICSurv|Long and BIC = BICLong+ BICSurv|Long) that allows us to assess the fit of each component of the joint model and in particular to assess the fit of the longitudinal component of the model and the survival component separately. Based on this decomposition, we then propose ΔAICSurv and ΔBICSurv to determine the importance and contribution of the longitudinal data to the model fit of the survival data. Moreover, this decomposition, along with ΔAICSurv and ΔBICSurv, is also quite useful in comparing, for example, trajectory-based joint models and shared parameter joint models and deciding which type of model best fits the survival data.

  {"id":"zhangBayesianModelAssessment2017","abstract":"Joint models for longitudinal and survival data are routinely used in clinical trials or other studies to assess a treatment effect while accounting for longitudinal measures such as patient-reported outcomes. In the Bayesian framework, the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the logarithm of the pseudo-marginal likelihood (LPML) are two well-known Bayesian criteria for comparing joint models. However, these criteria do not provide separate assessments of each component of the joint model. In this article, we develop a novel decomposition of DIC and LPML to assess the fit of the longitudinal and survival components of the joint model, separately. Based on this decomposition, we then propose new Bayesian model assessment criteria, namely, ΔDIC and ΔLPML, to determine the importance and contribution of the longitudinal (survival) data to the model fit of the survival (longitudinal) data.

Such potential prognostic factors can be measured on a continuous or categorical scale. Known risk factors measured on a continuous scale include age, body mass index, and volume of tumor. Risk factors measured on a categorical scale can be further classified as ordinal or nominal. Ordinal variables have a natural order, such as tumor grade, RTOG RPA risk categories,1 and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Nominal variables do not have an obvious ordering, such as sex and WHO CNS histological types. Many potential biomarkers are measured on a continuous scale. However, for ease of analysis and interpretation, these continuous measures are frequently converted into categorical variables. For example, although age at diagnosis is recorded as a continuous variable, for an analysis, patients are considered as either over or under 50 years of age. Cut-points such as 50 years of age are frequently arbitrary, based on the literature/clinical practice, or a percentile(s) of the observed patient data (eg, splitting at the sample median to guarantee an equal sample size between the low- and high-risk groups).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yalan"},{"family":"Molinaro","given":"Annette M"}],"citation-key":"zhangCategorizingContinuousBiomarkers2022","container-title":"Neuro-Oncology Practice","container-title-short":"Neuro-Oncology Practice","DOI":"10.1093/nop/npac012","ISSN":"2054-2577","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,1]]},"page":"81-82","source":"Silverchair","title":"Categorizing continuous biomarkers: More cons than pros","title-short":"Categorizing continuous biomarkers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nop/npac012","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"zhangNomogramSurvivalAnalysis2017","abstract":"Clinical research usually involves time-to-event survival analysis, in which the presence of a competing event is prevalent. It is acceptable to use the conventional Cox proportional hazard regression to model cause-specific hazard. However, this cause-specific hazard cannot directly translate to the cumulative incidence function, and the latter is usually clinically relevant. The subdistribution hazard regression directly quantifies the impact of covariates on the cumulative incidence. When estimating the subdistribution hazard, subjects experiencing competing event continue to contribute to the risk set, and censoring weights are assigned to them after the competing event time. The weights are the conditional probability that a subject remains uncensored, and can be modelled to depend on the covariates of a subject. The first option to perform regression on the subdistribution hazard was the crr() function in the cmprsk package. However, it is not straightforward to draw a nomogram, which is a user-friendly tool for risk prediction, with the crr() function. To overcome this problem, we show an alternative method to use a nomogram function based on result of subdistribution hazard modeling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhongheng"},{"family":"Geskus","given":"Ronald B."},{"family":"Kattan","given":"Michael W."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haoyang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Tongyu"}],"citation-key":"zhangNomogramSurvivalAnalysis2017","container-title":"Annals of Translational Medicine","container-title-short":"Ann Transl Med","DOI":"10.21037/atm.2017.07.27","ISSN":"2305-5839","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"page":"403","PMCID":"PMC5673789","PMID":"29152503","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Nomogram for survival analysis in the presence of competing risks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673789/","volume":"5"},

Joint models have received increasing attention on analyzing such complex longitudinal-survival data with multiple data features, but most of them are mean regression-based models. This paper formulates a quantile regression (QR) based joint models in general forms that consider left-censoring due to the limit of detection, covariates with measurement errors and skewness. The joint models consist of three components: (i) QR-based nonlinear mixed-effects Tobit model using asymmetric Laplace distribution for response dynamic process; (ii) nonparametric linear mixed-effects model with skew-normal distribution for mismeasured covariate; and (iii) Cox proportional hazard model for event time. For the purpose of simultaneously estimating model parameters, we propose a Bayesian method to jointly model the three components which are linked through the random effects. We apply the proposed modeling procedure to analyze the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study data, and assess the performance of the proposed models and method through simulation studies.

We applied SCINA to a wide range of datasets, and showed its accuracy, stability and efficiency, which exceeded most popular unsupervised approaches. SCINA discovered an intermediate stage of oligodendrocytes from mouse brain scRNA-Seq data. SCINA also detected immune cell population changes in cytometry data in a genetically-engineered mouse model. Furthermore, SCINA performed well with bulk gene expression data.

This study seeks to integrate multiple clinicopathological and genomic factors with dimensional reduction across machine learning algorithms to compare survival predictions.Methods:This is a secondary analysis of the data from a prospective cohort study of female patients with breast cancer enrolled in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC). We constructed a series of predictive models: ensemble models (Gradient Boosting and Random Forest), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN) for 5-year survival based on clinicopathological and gene expression data after K-means clustering with K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classification. Model performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, and calibration slope (CS). Model stability was assessed over 10 random runs in terms of ROC, accuracy, CS, and variable importance.Results:The analytic cohort is composed of 1874 patients with breast cancer. Overall, the median age was 62?years; the 5-year survival rate was 75%. ROC and accuracy were not significantly different between models (ROC and accuracy around 0.67 and 0.72 across models, respectively). However, ensemble methods resulted in better fit (CS) with stable measures of variable importance across 10 random training/validation splits.

  {"id":"zhaoVariationalAutoEncoderRegression2019","abstract":"While unsupervised variational autoencoders (VAE) have become a powerful tool in neuroimage analysis, their application to supervised learning is under-explored. We aim to close this gap by proposing a unified probabilistic model for learning the latent space of imaging data and performing supervised regression. Based on recent advances in learning disentangled representations, the novel generative process explicitly models the conditional distribution of latent representations with respect to the regression target variable. Performing a variational inference procedure on this model leads to joint regularization between the VAE and a neural-network regressor. In predicting the age of 245 subjects from their structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, our model is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods when applied to either region-of-interest (ROI) measurements or raw 3D volume images. More importantly, unlike simple feed-forward neural-networks, disentanglement of age in latent representations allows for intuitive interpretation of the structural developmental patterns of the human brain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingyu"},{"family":"Adeli","given":"Ehsan"},{"family":"Honnorat","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Leng","given":"Tuo"},{"family":"Pohl","given":"Kilian M."}],"citation-key":"zhaoVariationalAutoEncoderRegression2019","container-title":"Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

  {"id":"zheng:2023","abstract":"Basket trials are increasingly used for the simultaneous evaluation of a new treatment in various patient subgroups under one overarching protocol. We propose a Bayesian approach to sample size determination in basket trials that permit borrowing of information between commensurate subsets. Specifically, we consider a randomized basket trial design where patients are randomly assigned to the new treatment or control within each trial subset (“subtrial” for short). Closed-form sample size formulae are derived to ensure that each subtrial has a specified chance of correctly deciding whether the new treatment is superior to or not better than the control by some clinically relevant difference. Given prespecified levels of pairwise (in)commensurability, the subtrial sample sizes are solved simultaneously. The proposed Bayesian approach resembles the frequentist formulation of the problem in yielding comparable sample sizes for circumstances of no borrowing. When borrowing is enabled between commensurate subtrials, a considerably smaller trial sample size is required compared to the widely implemented approach of no borrowing. We illustrate the use of our sample size formulae with two examples based on real basket trials. A comprehensive simulation study further shows that the proposed methodology can maintain the true positive and false positive rates at desired levels.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zheng","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Grayling","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Mozgunov","given":"Pavel"},{"family":"Jaki","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Wason","given":"James M S"}],"citation-key":"zheng:2023","container-title":"Biostatistics","container-title-short":"Biostatistics","DOI":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxac033","ISSN":"1465-4644","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,1]]},"page":"1000-1016","source":"Silverchair","title":"Bayesian sample size determination in basket trials borrowing information between subsets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac033","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"zhongArtificialNeuralNetworks2021","abstract":"Abstract\n          \n            Background\n            Single-cell transcriptome (SCT) sequencing technology has reached the level of high-throughput technology where gene expression can be measured concurrently from large numbers of cells. The results of gene expression studies are highly reproducible when strict protocols and standard operating procedures (SOP) are followed. However, differences in sample processing conditions result in significant changes in gene expression profiles making direct comparison of different studies difficult. Unsupervised machine learning (ML) uses clustering algorithms combined with semi-automated cell labeling and manual annotation of individual cells. They do not scale up well and a workflow used on a specific dataset will not perform well with other studies. Supervised ML classification shows superior classification accuracy and generalization properties as compared to unsupervised ML methods. We describe a supervised ML method that deploys artificial neural networks (ANN), for 5-class classification of healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from multiple diverse studies.\n          \n          \n            Results\n            We used 58 data sets to train ANN incrementally – over ten cycles of training and testing. The sample processing involved four protocols: separation of PBMC, separation of PBMC + enrichment (by negative selection), separation of PBMC + FACS, and separation of PBMC + MACS. The training data set included between 85 and 110 thousand cells, and the test set had approximately 13 thousand cells. Training and testing were done with various combinations of data sets from four principal data sources. The overall accuracy of classification on independent data sets reached 5-class classification accuracy of 94%. Classification accuracy for B cells, monocytes, and T cells exceeded 95%. Classification accuracy of natural killer (NK) cells was 75% because of the similarity between NK cells and T cell subsets. The accuracy of dendritic cells (DC) was low due to very low numbers of DC in the training sets.\n          \n          \n            Conclusions\n            The incremental learning ANN model can accurately classify the main types of PBMC. With the inclusion of more DC and resolving ambiguities between T cell and NK cell gene expression profiles, we will enable high accuracy supervised ML classification of PBMC. We assembled a reference data set for healthy PBMC and demonstrated a proof-of-concept for supervised ANN method in classification of previously unseen SCT data. The classification shows high accuracy, that is consistent across different studies and sample processing methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Jiahui"},{"family":"Lyu","given":"Minjie"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Huan"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Zhiwei"},{"family":"Chitkushev","given":"Lou T."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guanglan"},{"family":"Keskin","given":"Derin B."},{"family":"Brusic","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"zhongArtificialNeuralNetworks2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.07.29.454293","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,30]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Bioinformatics","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Artificial Neural Networks for classification of single cell gene expression","type":"report","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.07.29.454293"},

Plasma DNA jagged ends are biomarkers for pathophysiologic states such as pregnancy and cancer. It remains unknown whether urinary cell-free DNA (cfDNA) molecules have jagged ends.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Jagged ends of cfDNA were detected by incorporating unmethylated cytosines during a DNA end-repair process, followed by bisulfite sequencing. Incorporation of unmethylated cytosines during the repair of the jagged ends lowered the apparent methylation levels measured by bisulfite sequencing and were used to calculate a jagged end index. This approach is called jagged end analysis by sequencing.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The jagged end index of urinary cfDNA was higher than that of plasma DNA. The jagged end index profile of plasma DNA displayed several strongly oscillating major peaks at intervals of approximately 165 bp (i.e., nucleosome size) and weakly oscillating minor peaks with periodicities of approximately 10 bp. In contrast, the urinary DNA jagged end index profile showed weakly oscillating major peaks but strongly oscillating minor peaks. The jagged end index was generally higher in nucleosomal linker DNA regions. Patients with bladder cancer (n = 46) had lower jagged end indexed of urinary DNA than participants without bladder cancer (n = 39).

With the increasing use of immune checkpoint blockades in clinical practice, a large number of patients develop acquired resistance. However, the knowledge about acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockades is limited and poorly summarized. In this review, we clarify the principal elements of acquired resistance to immune checkpoint blockades. The definition of acquired resistance is heterogeneous among groups or societies, but the expert consensus of The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer can be referred. Oligo-progression is the main pattern of acquired resistance. Acquired resistance can be derived from the selection of resistant cancer cell clones that exist in the tumor mass before therapeutic intervention or gradual acquisition in the sensitive cancer cells. Specifically, tumor intrinsic mechanisms include neoantigen depletion, defects in antigen presentation machinery, aberrations of interferon signaling, tumor-induced exclusion/immunosuppression, and tumor cell plasticity. Tumor extrinsic mechanisms include upregulation of other immune checkpoints. Presently, a set of treatment modalities is applied to patients with similar clinical characteristics or resistance mechanisms for overcoming acquired resistance, and hence, further research is required.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Binghan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Qian"}],"citation-key":"zhouAcquiredResistanceImmune2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","ISSN":"1664-3224","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Acquired Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Blockades: The Underlying Mechanisms and Potential Strategies","title-short":"Acquired Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Blockades","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.693609","volume":"12"},

Continuous monitoring with a confirmed biomarker of residual disease is a key component of CML management for early prediction of disease relapse. However, the longitudinal biomarker measurements have highly heterogeneous trajectories between subjects (patients) with various shapes and patterns. It is believed that the trajectory is clinically related to the development of treatment resistance, but there was limited knowledge about the underlying mechanism. To address the challenge, we propose a novel Bayesian approach to modeling the distribution of subject-specific longitudinal trajectories. It exploits flexible Bayesian learning to accommodate complex changing patterns over time and non-linear covariate effects, and allows for real-time prediction of both in-sample and out-of-sample subjects. The generated information can help make clinical decisions, and consequently enhance the personalized treatment management of precision medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Shouhao"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuelin"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Chan"},{"family":"Kantarjian","given":"Hagop M."}],"citation-key":"zhouBayesianLearningPersonalized2023","container-title":"Annals of Data Science","container-title-short":"Ann.

Underlying this recent body of literature on Bayesian propensity score estimation is an implicit discordance between the goal of the propensity score and the use of Bayes’ theorem. The propensity score condenses multivariate covariate information into a scalar to allow estimation of causal effects without specifying a model for how each covariate relates to the outcome. Avoiding specification of a detailed model for the outcome response surface is valuable for robust estimation of causal effects, but this strategy is at odds with the use of Bayes’ theorem, which presupposes a full probability model for the observed data that adheres to the likelihood principle. The goal of this article is to explicate this fundamental feature of Bayesian estimation of causal effects with propensity scores to provide context for the existing literature and for future work on this important topic.[Received June 2014.

  {"id":"zoh:2018","abstract":"We develop a Bayes factor based testing procedure for comparing two population means in high dimensional settings. In ‘large-p-small-n’ settings, Bayes factors based on proper priors require eliciting a large and complex p×p covariance matrix, whereas Bayes factors based on Jeffrey’s prior suffer the same impediment as the classical Hotelling T2 test statistic as they involve inversion of ill-formed sample covariance matrices. To circumvent this limitation, we propose that the Bayes factor be based on lower dimensional random projections of the high dimensional data vectors. We choose the prior under the alternative to maximize the power of the test for a fixed threshold level, yielding a restricted most powerful Bayesian test (RMPBT). The final test statistic is based on the ensemble of Bayes factors corresponding to multiple replications of randomly projected data. We show that the test is unbiased and, under mild conditions, is also locally consistent. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach through simulated and real data examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Zoh","given":"Roger S."},{"family":"Sarkar","given":"Abhra"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Raymond J."},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Bani K."}],"citation-key":"zoh:2018","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","container-title-short":"J Am Stat Assoc","DOI":"10.1080/01621459.2017.1371024","ISSN":"0162-1459","issue":"524","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"1733-1741","PMCID":"PMC6364997","PMID":"30739967","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A Powerful Bayesian Test for Equality of Means in High Dimensions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364997/","volume":"113"},

  {"id":"zouAssessmentRisksPredicting2009","abstract":"Risk assessment is fundamental to most epidemiological and biomedical investigations. In this article, risks are assessed in terms of risk difference and risk ratio by predicting counterfactual outcomes. Models considered for binary outcomes are probit, logistic, and extreme-value regressions. New confidence intervals for the effect measures are proposed using the method of variance estimates recovery, and evaluated by a simulation study. A SAS macro is provided for the calculations. A risk ratio obtained using counterfactuals is also compared in the simulation with that directly estimated from the modified Poisson model to answer a recent concern about the validity of the latter approach. Two examples are used to illustrate the methods.","author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"G Y"}],"citation-key":"zouAssessmentRisksPredicting2009","container-title":"Statistics in medicine","event-place":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont., Canada N6A5C1. gzou@robarts.ca","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"number":"30","page":"3761-3781","publisher-place":"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ont., Canada N6A5C1. gzou@robarts.ca","title":"Assessment of risks by predicting counterfactuals.","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&id=19856279&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks","volume":"28"},

Here we trained a machine learning model to predict mortality within 12 weeks of a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. By leveraging data on 33,928 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in eastern Denmark, we considered 2,723 variables extracted from electronic health records (EHR) including demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory test results and vital parameters. A discrete-time framework for survival modelling enabled us to predict personalized survival curves and explain individual risk factors. Performances of weighted concordance index 0.95 and precision-recall area under the curve 0.71 were measured on the test set. Age, sex, number of medications, previous hospitalizations and lymphocyte counts were identified as top mortality risk factors. Our explainable survival model developed on EHR data also revealed temporal dynamics of the 22 selected risk factors. Upon further validation, this model may allow direct reporting of personalized survival probabilities in routine care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Zucco","given":"Adrian G."},{"family":"Agius","given":"Rudi"},{"family":"Svanberg","given":"Rebecka"},{"family":"Moestrup","given":"Kasper S."},{"family":"Marandi","given":"Ramtin Z."},{"family":"MacPherson","given":"Cameron Ross"},{"family":"Lundgren","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Ostrowski","given":"Sisse R."},{"family":"Niemann","given":"Carsten U."}],"citation-key":"zuccoPersonalizedSurvivalProbabilities2021","DOI":"10.1101/2021.10.28.21265598","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,29]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Health Informatics","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Personalized survival probabilities for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients by explainable machine learning","type":"report","URL":"http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2021.10.28.21265598"},
