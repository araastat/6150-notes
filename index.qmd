# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Biological and Biomedical Data Science*, a second-year
course in the [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu)
[Masters in Data Analytics](https://analytics.georgetown.edu) program.

Biological and biomedical data are at the heart of many industries,
including the life sciences, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and
biotechnology, to name a few. Research and development in these
industries aim to create new knowledge about biology (human, animal or
agricultural) and use that knowledge to create products (medicines,
vaccines, seeds, pesticides) that can help their target audiences. Data
is central to these purposes, but unfortunately, like most things, it's
not quite so simple.

In data science, we have become used to situations where you have
massive amounts of data that are available to you for mining and
exploring, typically from tech giants, cloud providers and fintech. Data
in the life sciences is much more limited; a drug can be approved with
as few as 1000 patients in a clinical trial. Data is both harder and
more expensive to collect, and so we are often much more careful about
how we collect and utilize data.

The purpose to which we use the data is also quite different. Most data
science applications you may encounter revolve around *predictive
modeling*, where the intent is to create robust predictions even if the
model is a *black box*; we don't really care how the predictions are
generated but rather whether the predictions are accurate or robust. In
the life sciences, we're often more interested in what factors influence
the prediction, why we see the patterns we see, and can the patterns be
attributable to a set of factors either observable or imposed. So the
currency we deal with involves *correlations*, *associations* and
***causality***. We're interested to get an understanding of how Nature
**works**.

## The two cultures

Leo Breiman, in 2001, wrote a seminal and influential paper,
"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures", where he distinguished between
data models (classical statistical models) and algorithmic models (what
we now call 'black box' predictive models). This is an important
distinction to understand, since they require different mental models to
work with, and different arrangements of the data, and are also
interpreted and evaluated differently.

Perhaps you saw this distinction in the materials for DSAN 5000 and DSAN
5100.
